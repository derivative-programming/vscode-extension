Changed all image URLs from 'github.com/blob/main/' to 'raw.githubusercontent.com/main/' format which is required for proper image display on VS Code Marketplace. Updated MARKETPLACE-PUBLISHING-GUIDE.md to document the correct URL format and explain why blob URLs cause broken images.

Updated MARKETPLACE-PUBLISHING-GUIDE.md to correct the misinformation and add troubleshooting section explaining that VS Code Marketplace displays images from README.md, not package.json configuration.
