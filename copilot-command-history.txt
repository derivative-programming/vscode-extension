COMMAND: Review and fix user stories list view MCP tool tabs documentation
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

TASK:
Review the MCP tool for viewing user stories list view and the tab switching 
functionality. The user stories list view shows tabs: Stories, Details, Role Distribution.

ISSUES FOUND:
1. MCP tool description in server.ts had incorrect tab values:
   - Said "all" instead of "stories"
   - Said "roleAccess" instead of "analytics"
   - Missing "details" tab documentation

2. Tab descriptions were wrong:
   - Said "Role-Based Access (security requirements)" 
   - Should be "Role Distribution (analytics showing role distribution charts)"

CHANGES MADE:
File: src/mcp/server.ts (line ~964)
- Fixed tool description to list correct tabs: "Stories", "Details", "Role Distribution"
- Updated initialTab parameter values: "stories", "details", "analytics"
- Corrected tab descriptions to match actual implementation

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- User Stories view implemented in: src/webviews/userStoriesView.js
- Has 3 tabs with data-tab attributes: "stories", "details", "analytics"
- Tab switching handled by switchTab() function
- MCP command handler in: src/commands/mcpViewCommands.ts (had correct values)
- Documentation reference: docs/VIEWS-REFERENCE.md

VERIFICATION:
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
✅ Tab values now match actual webview implementation
✅ Descriptions accurately reflect tab functionality

COMMAND: Update user stories dev view MCP tool tabs documentation
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

TASK:
Update the MCP tool for the User Stories Development view to reflect the actual
8 tabs shown in the interface (screenshot provided by user).

ISSUES FOUND:
1. MCP tool description had completely wrong tab names:
   - Said: "Dev Queue", "All Stories", "Dev Metrics", "Dev History", "Dev Forecast", 
     "Dev Bottlenecks", "Dev Distribution", "Dev Trends"
   - Reality: "Details", "Dev Queue", "Board", "Sprint", "Developers", "Forecast", "Cost", "Analysis"

2. Tab parameter values were incorrect:
   - Said: "devQueue", "all", "devMetrics", "devHistory", "devForecast", 
     "devBottlenecks", "devDistribution", "devTrends"
   - Should be: "details", "devQueue", "board", "sprint", "developers", "forecast", "cost", "analysis"

ACTUAL TAB STRUCTURE (from screenshot and code):
1. Details - 13-column table with filters and bulk operations
2. Dev Queue - Drag-and-drop priority queue
3. Board - Kanban board with 5 status columns
4. Sprint - Sprint planning and burndown chart
5. Developers - Developer management and capacity planning
6. Forecast - Gantt chart timeline with working hours
7. Cost - Monthly cost analysis by developer
8. Analysis - 6 KPIs and 5 D3.js charts

CHANGES MADE:
File: src/mcp/server.ts (line ~994)
- Updated tool description with correct 8 tabs and accurate descriptions
- Fixed initialTab parameter values to match actual onclick="switchTab(...)" values
- Updated inputSchema description with correct tab names

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- User Stories Dev view implemented in: src/webviews/userStoryDev/userStoryDevView.js
- HTML structure in: src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts (line ~4674)
- Tab switching uses onclick="switchTab('tabName')" pattern
- Tab content divs use id="{tabName}Tab" pattern
- 8 tabs with values: "details", "devQueue", "board", "sprint", "developers", "forecast", "cost", "analysis"

VERIFICATION:
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
✅ Tab values match actual HTML onclick attributes
✅ Tab order matches screenshot: Details, Dev Queue, Board, Sprint, Developers, Forecast, Cost, Analysis
✅ Descriptions accurately reflect each tab's purpose
