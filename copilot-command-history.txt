2025-01-15: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Add Report Wizard Step 4 UX improvements

**Issue**: Report wizard step 4 needed focus and enter key handling
- When step 4 opens, focus should be on the 'target data object' dropdown
- On Enter key press, if dropdown has a value selected, move to the next step

**Solution Applied**:
- **Auto-focus on step open**: Added focus management to `showStep()` function with `targetObjectDropdown.focus()` when step 4 is displayed
- **Enter key handling**: Added keydown event listener for Enter key that triggers the "Next" button if a value is selected
- **Smart validation**: Enter key only triggers action when dropdown has a value (follows existing button enabled/disabled logic)
- **Consistent patterns**: Follows same UX patterns as Add Object Wizard and other modals in the application

**Technical Implementation**:
- Modified `showStep()` function to include focus management with setTimeout for proper DOM readiness
- Added keydown event listener for target object dropdown with Enter key detection
- Uses existing validation logic (only proceed if dropdown has value)
- Only triggers button click when a value is selected, preventing accidental navigation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/webviews/addReportWizardView.js`: Added 19 lines of focus and keyboard navigation code

**Implementation Details**:
- Focus is set using setTimeout(100ms) to ensure DOM is ready after step display
- Enter key uses keydown event for dropdown navigation consistency
- Uses existing selectedTargetObject value check for validation
- Follows established patterns from Add Object Wizard step focus management

**Testing Results**:
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Success
- ESLint: ✅ No warnings
- Focus behavior: ✅ Works correctly (verified with test file)
- Enter key validation: ✅ Respects dropdown selection requirement
- No regressions: ✅ Existing functionality preserved

**User Experience**:
- Step 4 opens with immediate focus on target data object dropdown
- Users can navigate dropdown with keyboard and press Enter without needing mouse
- Enter key gracefully ignored when no value is selected
- Matches behavior patterns of other wizard steps and modals


Command: Add column modal focus and enter key handling

2025-12-20: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Add column modal UX improvements

**Issue**: Report details view add column modal needed focus and enter key handling
- When modal opens, focus should be on the 'column name' textbox (single column tab)  
- When bulk columns tab opens, focus should be on the 'column name' textbox (bulk columns textarea)
- On Enter key press in single column input, trigger the 'add column' button if it's enabled
- On Enter key press in bulk columns textarea, trigger the 'add columns' button if it's enabled

**Solution Applied**:
- **Auto-focus on modal open**: Added `columnNameInput.focus()` when modal opens (single column tab is active by default)
- **Tab-based focus management**: Added focus handling when switching between tabs:
  - Single Column tab: focuses on "#columnName" input  
  - Bulk Add tab: focuses on "#bulkColumns" textarea
- **Enter key handling for single column**: Added keypress event listener for Enter key that triggers the "Add Column" button if enabled
- **Enter key handling for bulk columns**: Added keydown event listener for Enter key that triggers the "Add Columns" button if enabled, with Shift+Enter allowing new lines
- **Smart validation**: Enter key only triggers action when buttons are not disabled
- **Consistent patterns**: Follows same UX patterns as other modals in the application (property and parameter modals)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Modified `createAddColumnModal()` and `attachModalEventListeners()` functions in `clientScriptTemplate.js`
- Added focus handling in modal display and tab switching logic
- Added keypress event listener for single column input (keypress for text input)
- Added keydown event listener for bulk columns textarea (keydown to properly handle Shift+Enter)
- Uses existing validation functions for consistency
- Only triggers button clicks when buttons are not disabled

**Files Modified**:
- `src/webviews/reports/components/templates/clientScriptTemplate.js`

**Implementation Details**:
- Focus is set using setTimeout to ensure DOM is ready after modal display  
- Enter key uses keypress event for single input, keydown for textarea (to properly handle Shift+Enter)
- Shift+Enter in bulk textarea allows new lines, regular Enter submits
- All changes preserve existing functionality while adding the requested features
- Button clicks are only triggered if buttons are not disabled

Command: Add button modal focus and enter key handling

2025-06-15: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Add button modal UX improvements

**Issue**: Report details view add button modal needed focus and enter key handling
- When modal opens, focus should be on the 'button name' textbox
- On Enter key press, trigger the 'add button' button if it's enabled

**Solution Applied**:
- **Auto-focus on input**: Added `buttonNameInput.focus()` when modal opens
- **Enter key handling**: Added keypress event listener for Enter key
- **Smart validation**: Enter key only triggers action when input is valid (no validation errors)
- **Consistent patterns**: Follows same UX patterns as other modals in the application

**Technical Implementation**:
- Modified `attachButtonModalEventListeners()` function in `clientScriptTemplate.js`
- Added focus handling after modal is displayed
- Added keypress event listener that respects validation state
- Uses existing `validateButtonName()` function for consistency
- Only triggers `addButton.click()` when input passes validation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/webviews/reports/components/templates/clientScriptTemplate.js`: Added 24 lines, modified 1 line
- Added comprehensive test file to verify functionality works correctly

**Testing Results**:
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Success
- ESLint: ✅ No new warnings
- Focus behavior: ✅ Works correctly
- Enter key validation: ✅ Respects validation rules
- No regressions: ✅ Existing functionality preserved

**User Experience**:
- Modal opens with immediate cursor focus in button name field
- Users can type and press Enter without needing mouse
- Invalid input gracefully ignored on Enter key
- Matches behavior of other add modals in the application
 
 
Command: report details view - add column modal updates

2025-01-14: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Focus and Enter key handling for add column modal

**Changes Applied**:
- **Modified src/webviews/reports/components/templates/addColumnModalFunctionality.js**:
  * Added focus handling when modal opens - automatically focuses on column name input (single column tab is active by default)
  * Added focus handling for tab switching - focuses on appropriate input when switching between tabs:
    - Single Column tab: focuses on "columnName" input
    - Bulk Add tab: focuses on "bulkColumns" textarea
  * Added Enter key handling for single column input - Enter key triggers "Add Column" button if enabled
  * Added Enter key handling for bulk columns textarea - Enter submits (Shift+Enter for new lines)
  * Fixed close button selector bug - changed from ".close" to ".close-button" to match template
  * Updated all event listeners to use modal-scoped selectors (modal.querySelector) instead of global document.getElementById for better isolation
  * Added button enabled/disabled checks before triggering clicks

**Implementation Details**:
- Focus is set using setTimeout to ensure DOM is ready after modal display
- Enter key uses keypress event for single input, keydown for textarea (to properly handle Shift+Enter)
- Shift+Enter in bulk textarea allows new lines, regular Enter submits
- All changes preserve existing functionality while adding the requested features
- Button clicks are only triggered if buttons are not disabled

**User Experience Improvements**:
1. **Single Column tab**: Modal opens → cursor in column name input, Enter → submits if valid
2. **Bulk Add tab**: Switch to tab → cursor in textarea, Enter → submits, Shift+Enter → new line
3. **Tab switching**: Always focuses on the appropriate input field
4. **Keyboard-driven workflow**: Users can navigate and submit without mouse

**Testing**: Created manual test file at /tmp/test-column-modal.html to verify focus and keyboard behavior
 
 
Command: Object Hierarchy diagram updates - Enhanced search functionality with exact match focus and partial match highlighting

2025-06-15: Implemented enhanced search functionality for Object Hierarchy diagram
- Modified src/webviews/hierarchyView.js to add exact match focusing and partial match highlighting
- **Exact Match Focus**: When search text exactly matches a node name, that node is automatically selected and focused
- **Partial Match Highlighting**: When search text partially or exactly matches node names, those nodes get light green background
- **Search State Management**: Added proper cleanup of search highlights when search is cleared
- **Updated Functions**:
  * Enhanced searchObjects() function to track exact and partial matches separately
  * Added clearSearchHighlights() function to clean up search state
  * Modified update() function to apply light green highlighting for search matches
  * Updated selectNode() and closeDetailPanel() functions to preserve search highlighting when selecting/deselecting nodes
- **Technical Details**:
  * Uses node.searchHighlight property to track partial matches
  * Uses node.searchSelected property to track if node was selected via search
  * Light green color ('lightgreen') used for partial match highlighting as requested
  * Selection highlighting (blue) takes priority over search highlighting for focused exact matches
  * Search is case-insensitive and works with contains matching
- **Testing**: Created manual test file at /tmp/test-hierarchy-search.html to verify search behavior
- Build and lint successful with no new issues introduced

June 14, 2025 - User asked: "when a user adds a column by using the 'add column' modal, what happens?"

June 14, 2025 - User observed: "seems like it should be adding the new column to the model in memory first and then reload the view"

Analysis revealed current flow issue:
- Current: Frontend updates UI → Backend updates model → Only tree view refreshes
- Problem: Webview doesn't reload, so new column not visible in table until manual refresh
- Recommended: User submits → Backend updates model → Backend reloads entire webview with updated data
- This ensures model is single source of truth and UI stays synchronized

June 14, 2025 - User said: "implement this" (referring to proper add column flow)

2025-06-14: ✅ IMPLEMENTED proper add column flow where model is updated first and view reloads
- Modified src/webviews/reports/reportDetailsView.js:
  * Updated updateModelDirectly() function to accept panel parameter and reload webview
  * Added schema loading and view regeneration after model update
  * Modified updateModel message handler to pass panel reference
  * Now backend updates model THEN regenerates entire webview HTML
- Modified src/webviews/reports/components/templates/clientScriptTemplate.js:
  * Updated addNewColumn() function to not modify frontend state
  * Changed to send updateModel command and let backend handle UI updates
  * Updated inline modal handlers for both single and bulk column operations
  * Removed immediate UI updates (dropdown, currentColumns array modifications)
- Modified src/webviews/reports/components/templates/addColumnModalFunctionality.js:
  * Updated single column handler to rely on backend for UI updates
  * Fixed bulk column handler to send all columns in one operation
  * Removed frontend UI manipulation, let backend reload view instead

**New Flow Implemented**:
1. User submits column via modal (frontend)
2. Frontend sends updateModel command to backend (no local UI changes)
3. Backend updates model in memory first (single source of truth)
4. Backend regenerates and reloads entire webview with updated model data
5. User immediately sees new column in all views (dropdown, table, etc.)

June 14, 2025 - User reported: "the button on the modal to 'add column' does nothing"

Investigating modal button functionality issue...

2025-06-14: 🐛 FIXED - Add column modal button not working
- **Root Cause**: Event listeners were being attached before modal DOM was ready, and using global selectors instead of modal-scoped selectors
- **Issues Found**:
  1. Event listeners attached immediately after creating modal, but before DOM was fully ready
  2. Using `document.getElementById()` instead of `modal.querySelector()` - elements not found in global scope
  3. Functions defined inside event listener scope but needed in modal scope
- **Fix Applied**:
  * Modified createAddColumnModal() in clientScriptTemplate.js to use proper timing
  * Created separate attachModalEventListeners() function called after modal is shown
  * Changed all `document.getElementById()` to `modal.querySelector()` for proper scoping
  * Moved validation and helper functions inside attachModalEventListeners for proper scope
  * Event listeners now properly find modal elements and execute correctly
- **Result**: Add Column button now works properly, can add single and bulk columns with immediate view refresh

June 14, 2025 - User reported: "it looks like the tab is changed to 'settings' Can it stay on the columns tab if im adding a column?"

Issue: After adding column, view reloads but switches to default 'Settings' tab instead of staying on 'Columns' tab.
Need to preserve active tab state during view reload.

2025-06-14: ✅ FIXED - Tab preservation when adding columns
- **Issue**: After adding column, view reloaded but switched to default 'Settings' tab instead of staying on 'Columns' tab
- **Root Cause**: View regeneration always defaults to first tab (Settings) without preserving user's current tab state
- **Solution Implemented**:
  1. **Frontend Changes**: Modified addNewColumn() function to detect current active tab and send preserveTab parameter
  2. **Backend Changes**: Updated updateModelDirectly() to handle preserveTab parameter and send restoreTab message after view reload
  3. **Tab Restoration**: Added message listener and restoreActiveTab() function to client script for tab restoration
- **Technical Details**:
  * Frontend detects active tab using `document.querySelector('.tab.active').getAttribute('data-tab')`
  * Backend sends restoreTab message with 100ms delay after HTML regeneration
  * Client script listens for restoreTab message and restores correct tab state
  * Works for both single column and bulk column additions
- **Files Modified**:
  * clientScriptTemplate.js: Added tab detection, message listener, and restoration function
  * reportDetailsView.js: Added preserveTab handling and restoreTab message sending
- **Result**: Users stay on Columns tab when adding columns, maintaining better UX flow

June 15, 2025 - User asked: "why the delay on preserving the tab?"

**Answer about the delay**:
The 100ms delay was needed because:
1. `panel.webview.html = ...` triggers async DOM update in VS Code
2. If restoreTab message sent immediately, DOM elements might not exist yet
3. `document.querySelector()` would fail to find tab elements

**Improved Implementation**:
- Removed backend setTimeout delay
- Added client-side retry logic in restoreActiveTab()
- Tries immediately first, then retries after 50ms if elements not found
- More robust and responsive than fixed 100ms delay
- Handles timing issues at the client side where DOM state can be checked

June 15, 2025 - User requested: "The 'add filter' modal should work similar to this 'add column' modal"

Implementing add filter modal with same functionality as add column modal:
- Proper model updating (backend first, then view reload)
- Tab preservation (stay on Filters tab after adding)
- Same validation and user experience patterns

2025-06-15: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Add filter modal improvements to match add column modal
- **Updated addNewParam() function**:
  * Changed from updating frontend state to sending backend updates first
  * Added tab preservation (preserveTab parameter) to stay on Filters tab
  * Removed frontend UI manipulation (dropdown updates, currentParams array mods)
  * Now follows same pattern as improved addNewColumn()
- **Updated createAddParamModal() function**:
  * Restructured to use proper timing with attachParamModalEventListeners()
  * Changed from document.getElementById() to modal.querySelector() for scoped element selection
  * Fixed event listener attachment timing issues
  * Added proper bulk parameter handling with single backend update
- **Improvements Applied**:
  * Model-first approach: backend updates model, then reloads view
  * Tab preservation: users stay on Filters tab when adding filters
  * Proper validation and error handling
  * Single vs bulk add functionality works correctly
  * Immediate visual feedback through view reload
- **Result**: Add filter modal now works identically to add column modal with same UX patterns and reliability

Command: Refactor add button modal to match improved add column/filter pattern

June 15, 2025 - User requested: "now refactor the add button modal to follow the same backend-first pattern as the column and filter modals, but without bulk add functionality"

Implementing add button modal improvements to match add column and add filter modals:
- Update to backend-first approach (model updates first, then view reload)
- Add tab preservation (stay on Buttons tab after adding)
- Remove frontend state manipulation (no currentButtons array updates)
- Remove bulk add functionality (single add only)
- Follow same UX patterns as improved column/filter modals

Current Issues with Add Button Modal:
1. Updates frontend state directly (currentButtons.push)
2. Manually updates UI elements (buttonsList dropdown)
3. Doesn't preserve active tab after model update
4. Uses older event pattern (custom events) instead of newer modal pattern

Target Implementation:
- addNewButton() function should only send updateModel command to backend
- Include preserveTab parameter to stay on Buttons tab
- Remove direct UI manipulation - let backend reload view
- Use same modal creation pattern as addColumnModal and addParamModal
- Single button add only (no bulk functionality needed)

2025-06-15: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Add button modal refactored to match improved column and filter patterns

**Changes Applied**:
- **Updated addNewButton() function**:
  * Changed from updating frontend state to sending backend updates first  
  * Added tab preservation (preserveTab parameter) to stay on Buttons tab
  * Removed frontend UI manipulation (buttonsList dropdown updates, currentButtons array mods)
  * Now follows same backend-first pattern as improved addNewColumn() and addNewParam()
- **Created new Add Button modal system**:
  * Added getAddButtonModalHtml() function with simple single-button-add UI (no bulk functionality)
  * Created createAddButtonModal() function following same pattern as column/param modals
  * Added attachButtonModalEventListeners() with proper scoped event handling
  * Includes validation for Pascal case, alpha-only, uniqueness, and 100-char limit
- **Removed legacy modal handling**:
  * Removed old validateButtonName() function (duplicate)
  * Removed addButtonRequested custom event listener pattern
  * Replaced add button click handler to use new createAddButtonModal()
- **Result**: Add button modal now works identically to add column and add filter modals:
  * Model-first approach: backend updates model, then reloads view
  * Tab preservation: users stay on Buttons tab when adding buttons  
  * Proper validation and error handling
  * Single button add functionality (no bulk needed as requested)
  * Immediate visual feedback through view reload
  * No frontend state divergence issues

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- Button modal template embedded in clientScriptTemplate.js like column/param templates
- Uses same modal creation pattern with setTimeout for DOM readiness
- Event listeners scoped to modal instance using modal.querySelector() 
- Validation function local to modal scope to access currentButtons data
- Follows exact same UX flow: user submits → backend updates model → view reloads → tab restored

**Files Modified**:
- clientScriptTemplate.js: Added getAddButtonModalHtml(), createAddButtonModal(), attachButtonModalEventListeners()
- clientScriptTemplate.js: Updated addNewButton() to backend-first pattern
- clientScriptTemplate.js: Removed legacy event handling code
- Created addButtonModalTemplate.js: Standalone template file (for reference, embedded version used)

**Compilation**: TypeScript compilation successful with no errors

All three modals (add column, add filter, add button) now follow the same robust, backend-first pattern with tab preservation and consistent UX.
 
2025-06-15: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Add parameter modal focus and Enter key functionality

**Changes Applied:**
- **Added focus management to parameter modal**:
  * When modal opens, focus is automatically set on the 'parameter name' textbox (single tab is active by default)
  * When switching to bulk parameters tab, focus is set on the bulk parameters textarea
  * When switching back to single parameter tab, focus returns to the parameter name textbox
- **Added Enter key functionality**:
  * Single parameter tab: Enter key triggers 'add parameter' button if enabled
  * Bulk parameters tab: Enter key triggers 'add parameters' button if enabled (with smart handling)
  * Uses Shift+Enter to allow normal newline behavior in textarea
  * Only triggers button click if button is not disabled
  * Prevents default Enter behavior to avoid conflicts

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- Modified `createAddParamModal()` function to set initial focus after modal is displayed
- Enhanced `attachParamModalEventListeners()` with focus management in tab switching logic
- Added Enter key event listeners for both #paramName input and #bulkParams textarea
- Smart textarea handling: Enter submits only if textarea has content and Shift is not pressed
- Following established patterns from modelFabricationView.js for focus and keyboard handling

**Files Modified**:
- `src/webviews/reports/components/templates/clientScriptTemplate.js`: Added 49 lines of focus and keyboard functionality

**Testing & Validation**:
- Created comprehensive test file `/tmp/test-param-modal-focus.html` to validate functionality
- TypeScript compilation successful with webpack (no errors)
- ESLint passes (only pre-existing warnings in unrelated files)
- No new git changes beyond intended modifications

**UX Improvements Delivered**:
- Immediate keyboard accessibility - users can start typing when modal opens
- Seamless tab switching with automatic focus management
- Enter key submission for power users who prefer keyboard navigation
- Intelligent textarea behavior that respects both submission and text editing needs

All requirements from issue #144 have been successfully implemented and tested.
 
 
Command: Add data object wizard step 2 focus fix

January 15, 2025: Fixed the Add Object Wizard step 2 focus issue
- **Problem**: Step 2 focus was not working correctly because focus was set before the form content was regenerated
- **Root Cause**: 
  * `showStep(2)` was called before `updateStep2Display()`
  * This meant focus was set on the original `parentSearch` element
  * Then `updateStep2Display()` replaced the form content, creating a new search input
  * The focus was lost because it was set on the old element
- **Solution**: 
  * Reordered the calls in step 1 next button handler: call `updateStep2Display()` first, then `showStep(2)`
  * Updated focus logic in `showStep()` to get fresh element with `document.getElementById('parentSearch')` instead of using stale `parentSearch` variable
- **Changes Made**:
  * Modified step 1 next button event handler to call `updateStep2Display()` before `showStep(2)`
  * Updated step 2 focus logic to use `document.getElementById('parentSearch')` to get the current element
- **Testing**: Created test file `/tmp/test-wizard-step2-focus.html` to verify focus behavior
- **Impact**: Now when step 2 opens, focus correctly goes to the search textbox for both regular objects and lookup objects
- **Files Modified**: `src/webviews/addObjectWizardView.js` (8 lines added, 6 removed)

 
January 15, 2025: Enhanced the Add Object Wizard with focus management and keyboard navigation
- **Step 1 Updates**:
  * Added focus on 'Yes' radio button when step opens
  * Added Enter key handler to trigger 'Next' button when enabled
- **Step 2 Updates**:
  * Added focus on 'search parent objects' textbox when step opens
  * Added Enter key handler to trigger 'Next' button when enabled  
  * Fixed step 2 display to properly update when returning from step 1 with changed value
  * Enhanced step 2 to re-setup event listeners when parent selection form is regenerated
- **Step 3 Updates**:
  * Added focus on 'data object name' textbox when step opens
  * Added Enter key handler to trigger 'Create Object' button when enabled
- **Technical Implementation**:
  * Enhanced showStep() function with focus management using setTimeout for DOM readiness
  * Added keyboard event listeners for Enter key on each step
  * Created updateStep2Display() function to handle lookup vs regular object display changes
  * Added allObjects data to script scope for dynamic form generation
  * Added initial focus setup when wizard loads
- **Files Modified**: src/webviews/addObjectWizardView.js
- **Result**: Improved user experience with keyboard navigation and proper focus management throughout the wizard workflow

Command: data object details - properties tab - object lookup modal on 'fk object name'

2024-12-27: Implemented magnifying glass icon button for fKObjectName field with object lookup modal
- Created objectLookupModalTemplate.js with simple modal containing object list and Accept/Cancel buttons
- Created objectLookupModalFunctionality.js with modal interactions, selection handling, and double-click support
- Modified propertiesTableTemplate.js to add magnifying glass button for fKObjectName field using codicon search icon
- Updated clientScriptTemplate.js to import new modal components and pass allObjects array from backend
- Updated detailsViewGenerator.js to accept and pass allObjects parameter to client script
- Updated objectDetailsView.js to get all objects from modelService and pass to view generator
- Added lookup button CSS styling in detailsViewStyles.js with proper VS Code theme integration
- Enhanced propertyManagement.js to manage lookup button enabled/disabled state based on checkbox
- Added modal-specific styles for object list and button layout
- Added DOM event handler in domInitialization.js for lookup button clicks
- Implementation follows existing modal patterns and maintains consistency with codebase
- Lookup button appears to the right of textbox and left of checkbox as specified
- Modal pre-selects current value if present and updates textbox on Accept
- Button is properly disabled when field checkbox is unchecked

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- Field name is `fKObjectName` (capital K) as defined in schema line 333
- Uses `modelService.getAllObjects()` to populate object list
- Button disabled state managed through checkbox change events
- Modal supports both single-click + Accept and double-click for selection
- Follows VS Code design patterns with proper theming and icon usage
- Minimal changes approach - only added what's needed for this specific feature

2025-06-15: ✅ FIXED - Report details view display issue - Add Column and Add Filter sections embedded on all tabs

**Issue**: Modal content for "Add Column" and "Add Filter" sections was appearing at the bottom of all tabs instead of being hidden until modal is opened.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `addColumnModalHtml` and `addParamModalHtml` templates were being included directly in the main template HTML without proper modal wrapper containers
- These templates only returned `<div class="modal-content">` without the outer `<div class="modal">` wrapper that has `display: none` in CSS
- The templates were redundant since clientScriptTemplate.js creates these modals dynamically

**Solution Applied**:
- Removed `addColumnModalHtml` and `addParamModalHtml` from mainTemplate.js (lines 192-193 and 201-202)
- Updated mainTemplate.js function signature to remove unused parameters
- Updated detailsViewGenerator.js to match new function signature and removed unused imports
- Modal functionality is preserved via dynamic creation in clientScriptTemplate.js

**Files Modified**:
- `src/webviews/reports/components/templates/mainTemplate.js`: Removed modal HTML inclusions and updated function signature
- `src/webviews/reports/components/detailsViewGenerator.js`: Removed unused modal HTML generation and imports

**Result**: Add Column and Add Filter sections no longer appear at bottom of tabs, but modals still work when buttons are clicked.
