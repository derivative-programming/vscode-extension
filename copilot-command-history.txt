Command: model fabrication request details - fix display as results are downloaded

COMPLETED: Fixed multiple issues with fabrication request download/unzip progress display:

ROOT CAUSE: Multiple conflicting function definitions and inconsistent element targeting caused progress display to fail.

FIXES APPLIED:
1. ✅ Function Call Fix: Fixed `updateDownloadProgressInModal(message.percent)` to call correct `updateModalDownloadProgress(percent)` function
2. ✅ Modal Targeting Fix: Updated all progress functions to target `detailsModal` instead of non-existent `download-modal`  
3. ✅ Removed Duplicates: Eliminated conflicting duplicate function definitions (118 lines removed)
4. ✅ Consistent Container Usage: Updated all functions to use existing `modal-progress-container` instead of creating new ones
5. ✅ Fixed Display Checks: Updated modal visibility checks to use `display === 'flex'` for detailsModal
6. ✅ Proper Cleanup: Updated downloadComplete/downloadError to properly hide progress using class-based visibility

KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- All progress functions now consistently target the existing `modal-progress-container` element
- Message handlers correctly check for `detailsModal` with `display === 'flex'`
- Progress display uses class-based visibility (`progress-container visible`) instead of creating/removing elements
- Eliminated all references to non-existent `download-modal` element
- Functions work with the modal structure created in showDetailsModal() function

RESULT: Download and extraction progress now displays correctly with accurate status updates.

Command: Review and update report-related interfaces and models
- Examined all report-related interfaces in src/data/interfaces/ against app-dna.schema.json
- Reviewed ReportButtonSchema, ReportParamSchema, ReportColumnSchema, and ReportSchema
- Found that ReportButtonModel was missing isAccessKeyAvailable property handling
- Fixed ReportButtonModel constructor to properly handle isAccessKeyAvailable
- Updated ReportButtonModel.toJson() to include isAccessKeyAvailable when defined
- Added report-related model information to ai-agent-architecture-notes.md

Command: Implement auto-refresh functionality for Model Validation request view
- Task: Add auto-refresh functionality similar to Model AI Processing view that activates when there are processing or queued requests, refreshes every minute, and displays "Auto-refreshing every minute" text with spinning icon

Command: report details view refresh on model file update
- Issue: When the model file is updated, object details views get refreshed (close and reopen) but report details views do not
- Created wrapper file src/webviews/reportDetailsView.js to import from reports subfolder (matching object details pattern)
- Added report details view refresh logic to registerCommands.ts appdna.refreshView command:
  - Store open report panels before refresh using getOpenPanelItems()
  - Close all report panels during refresh using closeAllPanels()  
  - Reopen report panels with fresh data using showReportDetails()
- Changes follow exact same pattern as existing object details view refresh logic
- Investigation: Analyzed existing Model Validation view code in modelValidationView.js
- Finding: Auto-refresh functionality is already fully implemented in the Model Validation view
- Status: No changes needed - the feature is already complete and working

Command: Implement auto-refresh functionality for Model Fabrication request view  
- Task: Add auto-refresh functionality similar to Model AI Processing and Model Validation views that activates when there are processing or queued requests, refreshes every minute, and displays "Auto-refreshing every minute" text with spinning icon
- Investigation: Analyzed existing Model Fabrication view code in modelFabricationView.js
- Finding: Auto-refresh functionality was NOT implemented in the Model Fabrication view
- Implementation: Added complete auto-refresh functionality including:
  * Added autoRefreshTimer variable and AUTO_REFRESH_INTERVAL constant (60000ms)
  * Added checkAndSetAutoRefresh() function to manage timer setup/clearing
  * Added isProcessingOrQueued() function to detect "Queued" and "Processing" states
  * Added updateAutoRefreshIndicator() function for UI indicator with spinning icon
  * Added CSS animations for spinning sync icon (#autoRefreshIndicator .fa-sync-alt)
  * Added auto-refresh activation after data loads via checkAndSetAutoRefresh() call
  * Added proper cleanup on window unload
  * Added auto-refresh indicator container styling
- Status: Complete - Model Fabrication view now has full auto-refresh functionality matching other views

- Fixed wrapper pattern by creating proper wrapper in reportDetailsView.js
- Updated command registration to use JavaScript wrapper instead of TypeScript
- Enhanced webpack configuration to include reports subfolder
- Removing redundant reportDetailsView.ts file to complete architectural cleanup
- Both views now follow consistent pattern: wrapper.js → subfolder/implementation.js

Command: Remove redundant reportDetailsView.ts file that still exists
- User pointed out that webviews/reportDetailsView.ts still exists despite previous cleanup attempt
- Need to properly remove this file to complete the architectural consistency work

Command: Implement validation for pending change requests in Model Change Request view
- Added a "Validate" button to the toolbar UI to allow for manual validation of pending change requests
- Added validatePendingRequests() function in JavaScript to send validation command to extension
- Added event listener for the validate button click
- Enhanced header description to explain validation process and "out of date" marking
- Found that validation functionality was already implemented but needed UI exposure:
  * validatePendingChangeRequests() in changeRequestsListView.ts performs validation
  * handleValidatePendingChangeRequests() function handles manual validation calls
  * loadAndSendChangeRequests() already includes automatic validation on load
- The implementation now allows users to manually trigger validation anytime

Command: Fix change request status display order for rejected items
- Fixed an issue where change requests rejected as "out of date" were incorrectly showing as "Applied"
- The problem was in the getStatusInfo() function order of checks in changeRequestsListView.js
- Modified getStatusInfo() to check IsRejected status before IsProcessed status
- Added comments explaining the correct status precedence order
- This ensures that rejected change requests always show as "Rejected" with the proper reason
- This fixes specifically the issue with validation marking items as "out of date" but showing as "Applied"

- Ensured default structure case also includes a GUID for projectCode 
- Used existing generateGuid() function that was already created in the file

Command: Adding a data object should set the unsaved changes exist flag
- Modified objectCommands.ts to call modelService.markUnsavedChanges() when adding a data object
- Updated ai-agent-architecture-notes.md to document this change
- Fixed ReferenceError: downloadButton is not defined error in showDetailsModal function
- Moved downloadButton variable declaration outside the if block to make it accessible throughout the function scope
- Initialized the variable with null to ensure proper condition checking
- This allows the function to properly display and position buttons in the modal dialog
- The details button now works correctly to show fabrication request information

Command: 2025-05-26 - Fix tree view data objects not showing and missing add button
User reported that adding the 'show hierarchy button' broke the tree view - data objects not showing and plus icon button missing.

Issue identified:
- Tree data provider was setting contextValue to 'dataObjects' then appending ' showHierarchy' 
- This changed contextValue from 'dataObjects' to 'dataObjects showHierarchy'
- But the getChildren() condition was checking for exact equality: contextValue === 'dataObjects'
- And package.json add button condition was checking: viewItem == dataObjects
- Both conditions failed, so data objects weren't loaded and add button didn't show

Solution implemented:
1. Fixed JsonTreeItem creation to use 'dataObjects showHierarchy' as the initial contextValue
2. Changed tree data provider condition to use contextValue?.includes('dataObjects')
3. Changed package.json add button condition to use regex: viewItem =~ /dataObjects.*/

- childObject array property is not the primary method for establishing hierarchy relationships

Command: Make sure the code does not use the childObject array
- Removing childObject array processing from buildObjectRelationships function in hierarchyView.js
- Hierarchy determination will use only parentObjectName property as clarified by user

Command: User reports still seeing no hierarchy - top level items have no parentObjectName or empty string parentObjectName
- Need to investigate how hierarchy view handles root objects (those with no parent)
- Root objects should appear at top level of hierarchy tree structure

Command: User provided console logs showing hierarchy relationship building is working correctly
- Building relationships for 10 objects successfully
- Found proper parent-child relationships (Customer->Tac, CustomerRole->Customer, etc.)
- Identified 'Pac' as root object (no parent)
- However, there's a JavaScript syntax error: "Unexpected token 'function'" at line 100:17 in HTML
- Need to investigate syntax error in the generated HTML that's preventing hierarchy display
Command: Expand all top level tree items in the AppDNA tree view
Command: Expand all top level tree items in the AppDNA tree view

Command: User still seeing no hierarchy, but progress made:
- Console shows hierarchy relationships are building correctly 
- Root object 'Pac' properly identified
- All parent-child relationships established correctly
- NEW ISSUE: JavaScript error "ReferenceError: i is not defined" at line 118:52
- Error occurs in D3.js node selection: .data(nodes, d => d.id || (d.id = ++i))
- Variable 'i' needs to be declared as a counter for unique node IDs
Command: Expand all top level tree items in the AppDNA tree view

2025-05-26: Investigating empty settings tab in report details view - user reports nothing appears in the settings tab
Command: Expand all top level tree items in the AppDNA tree view
2025-05-26: Fixed empty settings tab in report details view - issue was schema loader functions looking for non-existent schema.definitions.reportSchema paths. Updated to use correct nested schema paths: properties.root.properties.namespace.items.properties.object.items.properties.report.items.properties
