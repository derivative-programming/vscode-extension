## 2025-09-14 - Added Lookup and Non-Lookup Data Object Count Metrics

**Command**: Add Lookup Data Object Count and Non-Lookup Data Object Count metrics to show data object breakdown

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Added both lookup and non-lookup data object count metrics

**Details**: 
- **New Metrics Implementation**: Added two complementary metrics to getCurrentMetricsData function:
  
  1. **Lookup Data Object Count**: 
     - Counts data objects where `isLookup === "true"`
     - Represents reference/lookup tables used for dropdowns and selections
     - Examples: Role, Status, Category lookup tables
  
  2. **Non-Lookup Data Object Count**:
     - Counts data objects where `isLookup !== "true"`
     - Represents main business entities/transactional data objects
     - Examples: User, Order, Product entities
     
- **Data Source**: Both metrics iterate through namespace.object array
- **Calculation Logic**: Simple boolean check on `isLookup` property for each object
- **Complementary Nature**: Lookup Count + Non-Lookup Count = Total Data Object Count
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Understanding model structure (reference data vs. business entities)
  - Assessing complexity of role requirements (non-lookup objects are used in role requirements)
  - Model design analysis and optimization
- **Architecture Notes**: These metrics help users understand the composition of their data model and the scope of objects involved in role-based access control

## 2025-09-14 - Fixed Role Extraction Logic to Use Specific 'Role' Data Object

**Command**: Correct role extraction logic to specifically target the 'Role' data object instead of generic lookup objects

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed role extraction for all role-related metrics

**Details**: 
- **Issue Identified**: Role extraction was using generic `isLookup === "true"` logic instead of specifically targeting the 'Role' data object
- **Root Cause**: Misalignment with role requirements view which specifically looks for data object named 'Role'
- **Correct Logic**: Roles come from the data object named 'Role' (case-insensitive match: `obj.name.toLowerCase() === 'role'`)
- **Metrics Updated**:
  1. **Role Count**: Now specifically extracts from 'Role' data object's lookup items
  2. **User Story Role Requirement Assignment Count**: Updated to use specific 'Role' data object logic
  3. **User Story Role Requirement Not Assigned Count**: Updated to use specific 'Role' data object logic
- **Consistency**: All three metrics now use identical role extraction logic matching roleRequirementsCommands.ts line 73-83
- **Expected Result**: Role counts should now be accurate and match exactly what appears in the role requirements view
- **Architecture Notes**: This ensures metrics extract roles from the designated 'Role' data object rather than scanning all lookup objects

## 2025-09-14 - Added Role Count Metric to METRICS Analysis View

**Command**: Add Role Count metric to show total number of roles in the model

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Added Role Count metric

**Details**: 
- **New Metric Implementation**: Added Role Count to getCurrentMetricsData function:
  - **Role Count**: Counts the total number of roles found in the model
  - **Data Source**: Extracts roles from lookup items in namespace objects
  - **Calculation Logic**:
    1. Find all objects where isLookup === "true"
    2. Iterate through their lookupItem arrays
    3. Add item.name to a Set (for uniqueness)
    4. Filter out roles named 'unknown' (case-insensitive)
    5. Return the size of the Set
  - **Consistency**: Uses exact same role extraction logic as role requirements metrics
  - **Unknown Role Handling**: Excludes 'unknown' roles to match role requirements view behavior
- **Use Case**: Provides visibility into the total number of roles defined in the model, useful for understanding the scope of role-based access control
- **Architecture Notes**: This metric helps users understand the breadth of their role definitions and complements the role requirement assignment metrics

## 2025-09-14 - Fixed Role Requirement Metrics to Match Role Requirements View Logic

**Command**: Align role requirement metrics calculation with role requirements view display logic

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed metrics to match role requirements view exactly

**Details**: 
- **Issue Identified**: Role requirement metrics were showing more counts than rows displayed in role requirements view
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Discrepancy in calculation logic between metrics and role requirements view
- **Fixes Applied**:
  1. **Actions Array Order**: Changed from `['View', 'View All', 'Add', 'Update', 'Delete']` to `['View All', 'View', 'Add', 'Update', 'Delete']` to match roleRequirementsCommands.ts line 125
  2. **Unknown Role Filtering**: Added same logic as role requirements view to skip roles with name 'unknown' (case-insensitive)
  3. **Consistent Logic**: Both Assignment Count and Not Assigned Count metrics now use identical logic to role requirements view
- **Expected Result**: Role requirement metrics should now exactly match the total number of rows displayed in the role requirements view
- **Verification**: Assignment Count + Not Assigned Count should equal the total rows shown in role requirements table
- **Architecture Notes**: Metrics now use exact same role extraction, data object filtering, action array, and combination generation logic as the role requirements view

## 2025-09-14 - Added User Story Role Requirement Not Assigned Count Metric

**Command**: Add User Story Role Requirement Not Assigned Count metric to complement assignment count

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Added User Story Role Requirement Not Assigned Count metric

**Details**: 
- **New Metric Implementation**: Added User Story Role Requirement Not Assigned Count to getCurrentMetricsData function:
  - **User Story Role Requirement Not Assigned Count**: Counts role requirement entries where access is 'Unassigned'
  - **Data Source**: Reads from `app-dna-user-story-role-requirements.json` file (same as assignment count metric)
  - **Calculation Process**:
    1. Extract all roles from lookup items in namespace objects
    2. Extract all data objects (non-lookup objects) from namespace
    3. Load app-dna-user-story-role-requirements.json and parse roleRequirements array
    4. For each role + data object + action combination, check if access == 'Unassigned'
    5. Count total unassigned requirements across all combinations
  - **Actions Checked**: ['View', 'View All', 'Add', 'Update', 'Delete']
  - **Unassigned Definition**: Role requirement has default 'Unassigned' access level (not yet configured)
- **Complementary Metrics**: This metric works with the existing Assignment Count metric to provide complete coverage:
  - Assignment Count: access != 'Unassigned' (Allowed, Required, Not Allowed)
  - Not Assigned Count: access == 'Unassigned' (default/unconfigured)
- **Architecture Notes**: Both metrics together should equal the total possible role requirement combinations, providing a complete view of requirements configuration status

## 2025-09-14 - Fixed User Story Role Requirement Assignment Count Metric File Path

**Command**: Correct file path for role requirements data in metrics calculation

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed file path to use correct role requirements file

**Details**: 
- **Issue Fixed**: Metrics calculation was using wrong filename for role requirements data
- **Previous Path**: `requirements.json` (incorrect)
- **Correct Path**: `app-dna-user-story-role-requirements.json` (matches roleRequirementsCommands.ts implementation)
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistency between metrics calculation and role requirements view data source
- **Verification**: Updated path matches line 134 in roleRequirementsCommands.ts where file is defined
- **Impact**: Metric will now correctly count assigned role requirements from the proper data file

## 2025-09-14 - Updated User Story Role Requirement Assignment Count Metric Implementation

**Command**: Update User Story Role Requirement Assignment Count metric to match role requirements view logic

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Updated User Story Role Requirement Assignment Count metric based on role requirements view

**Details**: 
- **Corrected Metric Implementation**: Updated User Story Role Requirement Assignment Count to match role requirements view behavior:
  - **Previous Logic**: Was counting user stories with extractable roles (incorrect)
  - **New Logic**: Counts role requirement entries where access is NOT 'Unassigned' 
  - **Data Source**: Reads from requirements.json file in same directory as model file
  - **Calculation Process**:
    1. Extract all roles from lookup items in namespace objects
    2. Extract all data objects (non-lookup objects) from namespace
    3. Load requirements.json and parse roleRequirements array
    4. For each role + data object + action combination, check if access != 'Unassigned'
    5. Count total assigned requirements across all combinations
  - **Actions Checked**: ['View', 'View All', 'Add', 'Update', 'Delete']
  - **Assignment Definition**: Role requirement is "assigned" when access is 'Allowed', 'Required', or 'Not Allowed' (anything except 'Unassigned')
- **Architecture Notes**: This metric now properly reflects role requirements assignment status as displayed in the role requirements view, where users can see and modify access levels for role/data object/action combinations

## 2025-09-14 - Added User Story Role Requirement Assignment Count Metric to METRICS Analysis View

**Command**: Add User Story Role Requirement Assignment Count metric based on user story role requirements view calculation logic

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Added User Story Role Requirement Assignment Count metric

**Details**: 
- **Metric Implementation**: Added User Story Role Requirement Assignment Count to getCurrentMetricsData function:
  - **User Story Role Requirement Assignment Count**: Counts user stories that have successfully extracted roles (not 'Unassigned')
  - **Calculation Logic**: Iterates through all user stories, uses extractRoleFromUserStory() to extract roles, counts stories where role extraction succeeds
  - **Helper Function**: Added extractRoleFromUserStory() function that matches patterns:
    - Pattern 1: "A [Role] wants to..." 
    - Pattern 2: "As a [Role], I want to..."
  - **Code Reuse**: Function implementation follows exact same logic used throughout extension (userStoriesView.js, userStoryTools.ts, requirementsFulfillmentView.js)
- **Architecture Notes**: Stories with extractable roles are considered "assigned", stories without extractable roles are "unassigned"

## 2025-09-14 - Added User Story Count Metric to METRICS Analysis View

**Command**: Add User Story Count metric based on user story view calculation logic

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Added User Story Count metric

**Details**: 
- **Metric Implementation**: Added User Story Count to getCurrentMetricsData function following namespace access pattern:
  - **User Story Count**: Total count of all user stories in `namespace.userStory` array
  - **Calculation Logic**: Accesses current model → first namespace → userStory array length
  - **Null Safety**: Includes proper checks for model existence, namespace array, and userStory array
- **Code Pattern**: Follows same approach used in user story views and MCP tools
- **Architecture Notes**: User stories are stored in the first namespace of the model as an array

## 2025-09-14 - Added Additional Metrics Rows to METRICS Analysis View

**Command**: Add rows for metrics: Page Count, Report Count, Form Count, Page Init Count, General Flow Count, Workflow Count, Workflow Task Count based on tree view calculations

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Added comprehensive metrics calculations

**Details**: 
- **Metrics Implementation**: Added 7 new metrics to getCurrentMetricsData function following exact tree view logic:
  - **Page Count**: Forms (isPage=true) + Reports (isPage=true or undefined)
  - **Report Count**: All reports from getAllReports()
  - **Form Count**: Object workflows with isPage=true (getAllPageObjectWorkflows())
  - **Page Init Count**: Workflows ending with 'initreport' or 'initobjwf'
  - **General Flow Count**: Workflows matching 5 criteria (!isDynaFlow, !isDynaFlowTask, isPage=false, !endsWith('initobjwf'), !endsWith('initreport'))
  - **Workflow Count**: Workflows where isDynaFlow=true
  - **Workflow Task Count**: Workflows where isDynaFlowTask=true
- **Code Accuracy**: Each calculation precisely matches the filtering logic used in jsonTreeDataProvider.ts
- **Architecture Notes**: Metrics provide comprehensive model statistics for analysis and monitoring

  - Label Text (labelText) - uses full property path
  - Is Visible (isVisible) - defaults to 'true'
- **Backend Integration**: Added addParamWithData command and function for property-rich parameter creation
- **Data Flow**: addNewInputControlWithData → addParamWithData → addParamToFormWithData → full parameter object
- **UI Enhancement**: Added missing data-data-size attribute to property checkboxes

**Architecture Notes**:
- Property-based controls use addParamWithData command vs manual controls use addParamWithName
- Full property metadata preserved from schema to in-memory model
- Label text uses property full path for better UX (e.g., "ObjectName.PropertyName")
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing single-name input control creation

## 2024-12-31 - Bug Fix: Forms Available Properties ModelService Method Error

**Command**: Fix TypeError: modelService.getFormTargetObject is not a function in forms available properties implementation

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed incorrect method call in getAvailablePropertiesForForm function

**Details**: 
- **Issue**: Called non-existent modelService.getFormTargetObject() method causing TypeError
- **Root Cause**: ModelService has getFormTargetChildObject() and getFormOwnerObject() methods, not getFormTargetObject()
- **Solution**: Updated function to use correct ModelService methods:
  - getFormTargetChildObject() for form target object
  - getFormOwnerObject() as fallback when no target object exists
- **Testing**: Extension compiles successfully after fix

**Architecture Notes**:
- Forms have targetChildObject property that references the target data object
- Owner object is the object that contains the form workflow definition
- Target child object is the actual data object the form operates on
- Proper fallback hierarchy: target child object → owner object → parent hierarchy

## 2024-12-31 - Avail Data Object Props Tab for Forms Input Controls

**Command**: Implement "Avail Data Object Props" tab for forms input controls modal to match reports functionality

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Forms modal now has property-based input control creation capability

**Architecture Notes**:
- Uses forms individual addParamWithName command vs reports bulk operations
- Extracts properties from form target/owner objects and parent hierarchy
- Supports FK lookup properties with nested property display
- Maintains property validation and duplicate checking
- Provides consistent UI/UX across forms and reports modals

## 2024-09-13 - Multi-Select Button Enhanced Validation

**Command**: Enhanced multi-select button modal with comprehensive validation to prevent duplicate button and flow names

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Modal now validates both button names and flow names before creation

**Details**: 
- **Frontend Validation**: Enhanced modal to check for existing button names using currentButtons array
- **Backend Validation**: Added validateMultiSelectButtonNames function to check for existing flows
- **Async Validation Flow**: Modal sends validation request to backend before proceeding with creation
- **Comprehensive Checks**: 
  - Button name uniqueness within the report
  - Generated flow name uniqueness within the destination context object
  - Proper error messaging for each validation failure scenario

**Architecture Notes**:
- **Frontend**: Enhanced validateButtonText function to check currentButtons array
- **Backend**: New validateMultiSelectButtonNames function that:
  - Validates button name doesn't exist in report.reportButton array
  - Constructs destination flow name using same logic as creation
  - Checks if flow name exists in destination object's objectWorkflow array
  - Returns detailed validation result via message passing
- **Message Flow**: 
  1. Modal sends 'validateMultiSelectButton' command
  2. Backend validates and responds with 'multiSelectButtonValidationResult'
  3. Modal either proceeds with creation or shows specific error message

**User Experience Improvements**:
- Button disabled during validation with "Validating..." text
- Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Seamless flow from validation to creation if all checks pass

**Files Modified**:
- src/webviews/reports/components/scripts/modalFunctionality.js - Enhanced validation and async flow

## 2024-09-13 - Multi-Select Button with General Flow Creation

**Command**: Enhanced multi-select button implementation to also create corresponding general flow in destination context object

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Multi-select button now creates both button and general flow

**Details**: 
- Added createGeneralFlowForMultiSelectButton helper function
- Function finds destination context object by name using getAllObjects
- Creates new objectWorkflow with name matching destinationTargetName
- Sets isPage: "false" to make it a general flow (not a page)
- Includes roleRequired from report for proper access control
- Prevents duplicate flows by checking for existing flow with same name

**Architecture Notes**:
- Uses modelService.getAllObjects() to find target object by name
- Initializes objectWorkflow array if it doesn't exist on the object
- Creates flow structure matching todo.md example:
  - name: destinationTargetName (e.g., "AIAssistantThreadConfigAIATMessageMultiSelectTest")
  - isPage: "false" 
  - roleRequired: from report's roleRequired property
  - objectWorkflowButton: empty array for future button additions

**Files Modified**:
- src/webviews/reports/reportDetailsView.js - Added createGeneralFlowForMultiSelectButton function and integration

**Validation**: ✅ Webpack compilation successful (530 KiB reports assets, no errors)

**Implementation Summary**: Multi-select button feature now creates both the report button AND the corresponding general flow in the destination object, providing complete end-to-end functionality as specified in requirements.

## 2024-09-13 - Multi-Select Button DestinationTargetName Format Update

**Command**: Update destinationTargetName construction to use proper format: [OwnerObjectName][Role][TargetChildObjectName]MultiSelect[ButtonName]

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - DestinationTargetName format corrected

**Details**: 
- Updated addMultiSelectButtonToReport function to construct destinationTargetName using the correct format
- Extracts roleRequired and targetChildObject properties from the report reference
- Constructs: (destinationContextObjectName || '') + (roleRequired || '') + (targetChildObject || '') + 'MultiSelect' + buttonName
- Example from todo.md: "AIAssistantThreadConfigAIATMessageMultiSelectTest"
  - AIAssistantThread (owner) + Config (role) + AIATMessage (target child) + MultiSelect + Test (button name)

**Architecture Notes**:
- Uses report.roleRequired property for the role part of the name
- Uses report.targetChildObject property for the target child object part
- Maintains backward compatibility with empty string fallbacks for missing properties
- Follows the exact pattern specified in todo.md example

**Files Modified**:
- src/webviews/reports/reportDetailsView.js - Updated destinationTargetName construction logic

**Validation**: ✅ Webpack compilation successful (528 KiB reports assets, no errors)

**Implementation Summary**: Multi-select button destinationTargetName now follows the correct format pattern as specified in requirements.

---

## 2024-01-14 - Multi-Select Button Implementation - FINAL OPTIMIZATION

**Command**: Optimize multi-select button implementation to use getReportOwnerObjectName method

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Final optimization applied

**Details**: 
- Updated addMultiSelectButtonToReport function to use modelService.getReportOwnerObjectName() directly instead of getReportOwnerObject().name
- This provides cleaner code and follows existing patterns in the codebase
- Maintains all functionality while simplifying the owner object name retrieval

**Architecture Notes**:
- getReportOwnerObjectName method already exists in ModelService and handles null checking internally
- This approach is consistent with patterns used elsewhere in the codebase
- Final implementation matches todo.md specification exactly:
  - buttonType: "multiSelectProcessing" 
  - destinationTargetName: reportName + "MultiSelect" + buttonName
  - destinationContextObjectName: from getReportOwnerObjectName()

**Files Modified**:

**Add General Flow Wizard Implementation - 2025-08-31**

## Task: Create Add General Flow Wizard
- Review existing FORMS treeview plus icon button and Add Form Wizard
- Create similar plus icon button for GENERAL flow treeview item
- Copy all files to create new "Add General Flow Wizard" view
- Follow same wizard steps as form wizard but for general flows
- Architecture: Similar to form wizard but creates objectWorkflow items without isPage="true"

**Fix Flow Name Generation Logic - 2025-08-31**

## Issue:
- General flow name generation logic was different from form name generation
- Missing role inclusion in flow names
- Incorrect action vs target logic
- Different title formatting

## Fix Applied:
Updated both generateFlowName() and generateFlowTitle() to match form wizard exactly:

1. **Name Generation Pattern:**
   - Before: `owner + (target || action || "GeneralFlow")`
   - After: `owner + role + action + (target if newInstance)`

2. **Title Generation Pattern:**
   - Before: Simple concatenation with spaces
   - After: Proper human-readable format: `[Action] [ObjectName]` or `[Action] [ChildObject]`

3. **Added convertToHumanReadable() function** for consistent CamelCase to spaced text conversion

**Remove Title Field from General Flow Wizard - 2025-09-13**

## Issue:
- General flows do not use the titleText property, only the name property
- Wizard was asking for unnecessary title input
- Created confusion between name and title fields

## Changes Applied:
1. **Removed titleText property** from created general flow object
2. **Updated Step 5 HTML** from "Name and Title" to just "Name"
3. **Removed title input field** and validation from UI
4. **Removed validateTitle case** from message handler
5. **Removed generateFlowTitle function** entirely
6. **Updated all generateFlowTitle() calls** throughout the code
7. **Simplified updateCreateButton** to only validate name
8. **Updated createGeneralFlow data** to exclude flowTitle

Result: Cleaner, more focused wizard that only collects necessary information.

Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
Architecture: Maintained existing patterns while simplifying the interface

4. **Improved Logic:**
   - Uses 'Add' as default action for new instances
   - Includes role in name generation
   - Proper conditional logic for target vs owner object naming

Build Status: ✅ Successful compilation
Now matches form wizard naming patterns exactly

**Fix Step 2 'Required Role' Dropdown - 2025-08-31**

## Issue:
- Step 2 'Required Role' dropdown items were incorrect
- Was showing Role object names instead of actual role values
- Root cause: Logic copied Role object names directly instead of extracting lookupItem values

## Fix Applied:
1. Updated role options generation to extract from Role objects' lookupItem arrays
2. Changed filter to use obj.lookupItem and item.displayName properties  
3. Updated conditions to check roleOptions.length instead of roleObjects.length
4. Now matches form wizard pattern exactly

Code Changes:
- Extract role options: roleObjects.filter(obj => obj.lookupItem).flatMap(obj => obj.lookupItem).filter(item => item.displayName)
- Use item.displayName for option values and display text
- Updated hasRoleObjects logic to use roleOptions.length

Build Status: ✅ Successful compilation

**Duplicate Command Registration Fix - 2025-08-31**

## Issue: 
- Extension activation failed with error: "command 'appdna.showGeneralFlowDetails' already exists"
- Root cause: Command was being registered multiple times in registerCommands.ts

## Fix Applied:
1. Removed duplicate registrations at lines 498 and 1065 in registerCommands.ts
2. Added proper import: `import { registerGeneralFlowCommands } from './generalFlowCommands'`
3. Replaced manual registrations with function call: `registerGeneralFlowCommands(context, modelService)`
4. Build Status: ✅ Successful compilation, no more duplicate errors

**Add Report Wizard Bug Fix - 2025-08-31**

## Issue Identified:
- When selecting "Table" visualization in the Add Report Wizard, it didn't proceed to Step 4 (Target Object Selection)
- Root cause: Case sensitivity mismatch between data-value "Grid" and comparison string 'grid' (lowercase)

## Changes Made:
1. **Fixed Step 3 Next Button Logic**: Updated comparison from 'grid' to 'Grid' to match data-value
2. **Fixed Navigation Step Skipping**: Updated nextStep() function to use 'Grid' instead of 'grid'
3. **Fixed Back Navigation**: Updated previousStep() function to use 'Grid' instead of 'grid'  
4. **Fixed Step 5 Back Button**: Updated step5BackBtn logic to use 'Grid' instead of 'grid'
5. **Fixed Report Name Generation**: Updated generateReportName() function to use 'Grid' instead of 'grid'

## Files Modified:

### `src/webviews/addReportWizardView.js`
- Line 768: `if (selectedVisualization === 'Grid')` (was 'grid')
- Line 676: `if (nextStepNumber === 4 && selectedVisualization !== 'Grid')` (was 'grid')
- Line 694: `if (prevStepNumber === 4 && selectedVisualization !== 'Grid')` (was 'grid')
- Line 848: `if (selectedVisualization === 'Grid')` (was 'grid')
- Line 899: `if (selectedVisualization === 'Grid' && selectedTargetObject)` (was 'grid')

## Architecture Notes:
- The HTML uses data-value="Grid" (uppercase) which is correct and consistent with other parts of the codebase
- The visualization type is stored and used as "Grid" throughout the system
- This fix ensures proper wizard navigation flow for table/grid reports

**API Endpoints Tab Improvements - 2025-08-31**

## Changes Made:
1. **Removed Add Endpoint Button**: Eliminated the 'Add Endpoint' button and related functionality
2. **Skipped Subscription Controls**: No subscription controls added (as requested)
3. **Fixed Move Button States**: Added missing event listener to update move up/down button states when endpointsList selection changes
4. **Added Sort Button**: Added alphabetical sorting functionality for endpoints list
3. **Enhanced Property Field Generation**: Improved to match form input controls pattern

## Files Modified:

### 1. `src/webviews/apis/components/templates/mainTemplate.js`
- Removed the `<div class="view-icons">` section containing the Add Endpoint button
- Streamlined the endpoints tab layout

### 2. `src/webviews/apis/components/templates/endpointsListTemplate.js`  
- Enhanced property field generation to match form input controls pattern
- Added support for boolean enum default values
- Implemented proper checkbox pattern with `control-with-checkbox` wrapper
- Added browse button support for specific fields (sourceObjectName, targetObjectName)
- Used proper `readonly` attributes for text inputs instead of `disabled`
- Improved tooltip and schema-based default value handling

### 3. `src/webviews/apis/components/scripts/endpointManagementFunctions.js`
- Removed `addEndpoint()` function completely

## 2025-01-27 - Fixed labelText Usage for Property-Based Input Controls

**Command**: Updated property-based input control creation to use actual labelText from schema instead of defaulting to fullPath

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Properties now display and use correct labelText from data object properties

**Details**:
- **Backend Enhancement**: Modified getAvailablePropertiesForForm to extract labelText property from both regular and lookup properties
- **Frontend Update**: Updated populateAvailableProperties to include labelText in data attributes and use as primary display text
- **Fallback Logic**: Uses labelText first, then fullPath, then controlName as fallbacks for proper display
- **Data Flow**: Property schema labelText → backend extraction → frontend display → input control creation

**Architecture Notes**:
- Properties have labelText field in schema for UI display purposes
- Better utilizes existing schema structure instead of generating display text
- Maintains backward compatibility with fullPath fallback for properties without labelText

## 2025-01-27 - Removed Lookup Properties from Forms Available Properties List

**Command**: Simplified forms available properties list by removing lookup properties with nested format (e.g., 'Tac.PacID.Pac.Description')

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Forms now only show regular properties in available properties list

**Details**:
- **Backend Simplification**: Removed FK lookup property generation logic from getAvailablePropertiesForForm function
- **Frontend Cleanup**: Removed lookup property handling, data attributes, and styling from property display
- **Simplified Logic**: Forms now only handle regular properties with format [ObjectName][PropertyName]
- **Better UX**: Cleaner property list without confusing nested lookup property paths

**Architecture Notes**:
- Forms use simpler property model compared to reports
- Regular properties only: no complex lookup chains needed for form input controls
- Maintains FK indicator for properties that are foreign keys but doesn't expand their lookup chains

## 2025-01-27 - Enhanced FK Property Support for Form Input Controls

**Command**: Enhanced property-based input control creation to properly handle FK lookup properties with required FK metadata

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - FK properties now include all necessary FK metadata when creating input controls

**Details**:
- **Frontend Enhancement**: Added FK data attributes extraction (data-is-fk-lookup, data-fk-object-name) from property checkboxes
- **Control Creation Logic**: Enhanced to detect FK properties and include FK metadata in control data
- **Backend Integration**: Updated addParamToFormWithData to set FK properties (isFKLookup, fKObjectName, isFKList) when applicable
- **Property Detection**: Properties with isFKLookup='true' now properly create input controls with FK configuration

**Architecture Notes**:
- FK properties automatically get isFKLookup='true', fKObjectName from source property, and isFKList='false' by default
- Maintains separation between regular properties and FK lookup properties in input control creation
- FK metadata ensures proper form input control behavior for foreign key relationships
