2025-01-20: Fixed VS Code Marketplace screenshot display issue. Removed invalid 'screenshots' array from package.json (not supported by VS Code extensions) and properly added all 5 screenshots to README.md using markdown image syntax with GitHub URLs. Updated MARKETPLACE-PUBLISHING-GUIDE.md to correct the misinformation and add troubleshooting section explaining that VS Code Marketplace displays images from README.md, not package.json configuration.
