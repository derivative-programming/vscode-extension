2025-08-24  architectural-independence-complete (General Flow completely independent from Forms)
2025-08-24  architectural-correction-direct-handlers (General Flow → Page Init patterns)
- Change: Completely removed General Flow's dependency on Forms button management modules; implemented direct button handlers matching Page Init's exact patterns.
- Files: src/webviews/generalFlow/components/templates/clientScriptTemplate.js (removed Forms imports, added direct handlers)
- Architecture: General Flow now has standalone implementation like Page Init instead of importing shared Forms modules.
- Rationale: Page Init doesn't use Forms files and is the "correct" reference; modifying shared Forms modules was wrong approach.
- Implementation: Direct addEventListener handlers for all buttons (copy, move up/down, reverse, add) with identical message formats and patterns as Page Init.
- Button Coverage: copyParamsButton, moveUpParamsButton, moveDownParamsButton, reverseParamsButton, copyOutputVarButton, moveUpOutputVarButton, moveDownOutputVarButton, reverseOutputVarButton, add-param-btn, add-output-var-btn.
- Status: Completed; General Flow now independent of Forms modules with Page Init-matching functionality.

2025-08-24  iteration-3-copy-button-alignment (Forms modules → Page Init style)
- Change: Aligned Forms module copy button handlers to match Page Init's simplified approach; removed excessive error handling and fallback code for consistency.
- Files: src/webviews/forms/components/scripts/outputVariableManagementFunctions.js (copyOutputVarButton), src/webviews/forms/components/scripts/parameterManagementFunctions.js (copyParamsButton)
- Analysis: Forms modules had robust error handling with try/catch, fallbacks, console logging; Page Init uses simpler approach without these features.
- Rationale: Page Init stated as "correct" reference; consistency requires matching its patterns exactly rather than using "better" implementations.
- Architecture: Both systems now use identical copy button patterns with same variable naming and feedback mechanisms.
- Status: Completed; no further changes necessary - comprehensive review found all button/modal functionality now matches Page Init patterns.

2025-08-24  iteration-2-current-data-sync (General Flow refresh functions)
- Change: Fixed critical issue where General Flow refresh functions didn't update currentOutputVars/currentParams arrays while Forms modules relied on these for move button validation.
- Files: src/webviews/generalFlow/components/templates/clientScriptTemplate.js (refreshOutputVarsList, refreshParamsList functions)
- Analysis: Page Init updates currentOutputVars in refresh, but General Flow was missing this. Move down logic checks `selectedIndex < currentOutputVars.length - 1` which would fail.
- Root Cause: General Flow delegates to refresh functions but forgot to sync data arrays, while Page Init does inline refresh with proper data updates.
- Architecture: Both systems now maintain identical refresh patterns with proper data synchronization for move button validation.
- Status: Completed; move buttons should now work correctly after operations.

2025-08-23  comprehensive-button-modal-review (Page Init vs General Flow)
- Change: Fixed critical message format inconsistency where Forms module output variable move handlers used wrong format compared to Page Init; updated Forms move handlers to match Page Init's `data` wrapper format.
- Files: src/webviews/forms/components/scripts/outputVariableManagementFunctions.js (moveUpOutputVarButton, moveDownOutputVarButton handlers)
- Analysis: Comprehensive comparison revealed Page Init uses `{command: 'moveOutputVar', data: {fromIndex: X, toIndex: Y}}` while Forms used `{command: 'moveOutputVar', fromIndex: X, toIndex: Y}` causing General Flow move buttons to fail.
- Architecture: General Flow imports Forms module handlers; Page Init has direct handlers; backend expects Page Init format.
- Button Coverage: ✅ All buttons exist in both views ✅ All have handlers ❌ Message formats mismatched
- Modal Coverage: ✅ Both use identical addOutputVariableModal with matching message formats ✅ General Flow has additional addInputControlModal (Page Init doesn't need params)
- Status: Completed; proactive systematic review vs reactive piecemeal fixes as requested.

2025-08-23  modal-overlay-fix (generalFlow)
- Change: Removed static modal HTML injection from General Flow main template/generator to prevent orphan .modal-content rendering under tabs; rely on dynamic modals appended to document.body via forms modal functionality.
- Files: src/webviews/generalFlow/components/detailsViewGenerator.js; src/webviews/generalFlow/components/templates/mainTemplate.js
- Rationale: Stacking context and missing .modal wrapper caused modal content to appear beneath tab content. Dynamic body-level modals mirror Page Init behavior and resolve z-index issues.
- Status: Completed; no TS changes; webview JS only.

2025-08-23  output-var-optional-items-parity (generalFlow)
- Change: Switched General Flow output variable list field template to reuse Page Init’s `getOutputVarsListTemplate` (allowlist + checkbox pattern) so optional items behave identically.
- Files: src/webviews/generalFlow/components/templates/outputVarsTableTemplate.js
- Rationale: Follow Page Init details view patterns exactly for optional output var properties.
- Status: Completed.

2025-08-23  param-optional-items-allowlist (generalFlow)
- Change: Implemented Page Init-style allowlist + checkbox pattern for General Flow params list template; adds fixed order, enum handling defaults, and browse-button parity.
- Files: src/webviews/generalFlow/components/templates/paramsListTemplate.js
- Rationale: Narrow optional items for params to match Page Init view patterns as requested.
- Status: Completed.
2025-08-23T02:20:00Z | cmd: whats the error here? flowchart TD [with Mermaid syntax error] | status: success | notes: Fixed Mermaid "Syntax error in text" caused by <br/> HTML tags in node labels. Modified formatMermaidDisplayText() function to replace HTML line breaks with dash separator format. Changed from "Title<br/>(Name)" to "Title - (Name)" to ensure Mermaid compatibility. The <br/> tags were not properly supported in Mermaid node text causing syntax parsing errors. Modified src/webviews/pageflow/components/htmlGenerator.js.
2025-08-23T02:15:00Z | cmd: get message 'maximum text size in diagram exceeded' | status: success | notes: Fixed Mermaid "maximum text size in diagram exceeded" error by adding maxTextSize: 500000 to mermaid.initialize() configuration. This increases the limit from the default 50,000 characters to 500,000 characters, allowing for much larger and more complex page flow diagrams without hitting the text size limit. Modified src/webviews/pageflow/components/htmlGenerator.js.
2025-08-23T02:00:00Z | cmd: increase the maxedges to 2000. give a dropdown to allow a change of layout so i can view all options | status: success | notes: Enhanced Mermaid configuration in Page Flow view. Updated mermaid.initialize() to include maxEdges: 2000 for handling larger diagrams. Added dynamic layout selection with current layout value from dropdown. Added new "Layout Engine" dropdown with options: Dagre (Default), ELK (Advanced), Dagre-D3. Added handleMermaidLayoutChange() function to re-initialize Mermaid when layout changes. Enhanced flowchart configuration to set defaultRenderer based on selected layout. Modified src/webviews/pageflow/components/htmlGenerator.js.
2025-01-17T18:00:00Z | cmd: fix page init move button states | status: success | notes: Fixed move up/down button state updates in Page Init Flow detail view - replaced manual button state logic in refreshOutputVarsList handler with centralized updateMoveButtonStates() function call for consistency.
2025-08-18T18:00:00Z | cmd: fix page init flow edit button error | status: success | notes: Fixed extension context missing error when clicking page init flow edit button from report details view - added missing extensionContext parameter to showPageInitDetails call.
2025-08-18T22:15:15Z | cmd: add copy button to page init flow details | status: success | notes: Added "Copy Page Init Flow Name" button to Page Init details view header. Implemented copyPageInitFlowName() function with clipboard API, visual feedback (icon changes to check), and styling to match VS Code design. Follows same pattern as report details copy button. Modified 3 files: mainTemplate.js (button), clientScriptTemplate.js (function), detailsViewStyles.js (CSS).
2025-08-23T00:00:00Z | cmd: implement page initialization flow header text in page preview | status: success | notes: Added functionality to display page initialization flow output variables with isHeaderText=true as header text above form controls/report filters in page preview. Created findInitializationWorkflow() and generatePageInitHeaderText() helper functions. Modified generateFormPreviewHTML() and generateReportPreviewHTML() to include header text. Added CSS styling for .page-init-header-text section. Displays format '[labelText]: [output var name] value' for variables with isHeaderText=true.
2025-08-23T00:15:00Z | cmd: fix page preview function scope error | status: success | notes: Fixed "Uncaught ReferenceError: findInitializationWorkflow is not defined" error in page preview. Moved helper functions findInitializationWorkflow() and generatePageInitHeaderText() from module scope into browser JavaScript context within the script section. Functions now accessible to generateFormPreviewHTML() and generateReportPreviewHTML() during runtime. Page preview dropdown selection now works correctly.
2025-08-23T01:00:00Z | cmd: review page list view column width and horizontal scrollbar issues | status: success | notes: Fixed page list table with wide columns lacking horizontal scrollbar. Changed .table-container CSS from 'overflow: hidden' to 'overflow-x: auto; overflow-y: hidden' to enable horizontal scrolling. Added min-width: 1200px to table, white-space: nowrap to cells, max-width/text-overflow: ellipsis for content truncation, hover expansion, and column-specific widths for all 8 columns. Users can now scroll horizontally to view all columns when content is wide. Modified src/commands/pageListCommands.ts.
2025-08-23T01:15:00Z | cmd: change owner object filter to textbox | status: success | notes: Changed the 'Owner Object' filter from a dropdown select to a text input in page list view. Updated HTML template in pageListCommands.ts to use input element with placeholder. Modified filtering logic in pageListView.js to use partial matching (.toLowerCase().includes()) instead of exact matching. Removed owner object dropdown population logic from populateFilterDropdowns() and extractFilterOptions() functions. Updated filterOptions object to remove ownerObjects array. Users can now type to filter by owner object name with partial matching. Modified src/commands/pageListCommands.ts and src/webviews/pageListView.js.
2025-08-18T00:00:00Z | cmd: npm run -s compile | status: success | notes: PageInit settings tab now hides 'Is Dyna Flow Task'.
2025-08-17T00:02:00Z | cmd: npm run -s compile | status: success | notes: PageInit output vars template updated to show labelText and isLabelVisible; build ok.
2025-08-17T00:00:00Z | cmd: npm run -s compile | status: success | notes: Updated objectWorkflowOutputVar interface/model to match schema; removed non-schema fields; webpack build completed successfully.
2025-08-17 21:00 - Implemented Page Init Details view (settings + output vars), wired appdna.showWorkflowDetails and Page Init List → details. Fixed client script newline bug by joining names with "\n". Status: completed. Notes: New files under src/webviews/pageinits/*; no changes to MCP provider errors.

## 2025-08-18 - Add Output Variable Modal Feature for Page Init Details View

**Command**: Review and implement the same "Add Output Variable" button and modal functionality from Forms Details View to Page Init Details View.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Bug Fix 1**: Fixed "getAddOutputVariableModalHtml is not defined" error by including modal template function inline.
**Bug Fix 2**: Fixed modal styling issues by adding comprehensive CSS styles to match forms design.

**Files Modified**:
1. `src/webviews/pageinits/pageInitDetailsView.js` - Added message handlers and backend functions
2. `src/webviews/pageinits/components/templates/addOutputVariableModalFunctionality.js` - NEW FILE - Modal functionality
3. `src/webviews/pageinits/components/templates/modalTemplates.js` - Enhanced modal templates
4. `src/webviews/pageinits/components/templates/clientScriptTemplate.js` - Added button click handler and modal template function inline
5. `src/webviews/pageinits/styles/detailsViewStyles.js` - Added comprehensive modal styling

**Implementation Details**:
- Added `addOutputVar` and `addOutputVarWithName` message handlers to page init details view
- Created `addOutputVarToPageInit()` and `addOutputVarToPageInitWithName()` backend functions
- Added modal functionality with single/bulk add capabilities
- Added button click handler for `add-output-var-btn`
- Enhanced modal template to include functionality script
- Fixed scope issue by including `getAddOutputVariableModalHtml()` function inline in client script template
- Added comprehensive modal CSS styling including tabs, form elements, buttons, and validation messages
- Followed the same architecture pattern as forms for consistency

**Bug Fix Details**:
1. **JavaScript Error**: The error "getAddOutputVariableModalHtml is not defined" occurred because the modal template function wasn't available in the client-side JavaScript scope. Fixed by importing and including the function inline.

2. **Modal Styling Issues**: The modal was displaying but with incorrect styling (unstyled tabs, buttons, form elements). Fixed by adding comprehensive CSS styles including:
   - Tab styling with hover states and active states
   - Modal form row styling with proper layout
   - Input field styling matching VS Code theme
   - Button styling with hover states
   - Validation error styling
   - Field note styling

**Architecture Notes**:
- Page Init details view now has complete parity with Forms details view for output variable management
- Modal follows the same validation and user interaction patterns
- Backend functions handle the specific data structure of page init flows (`objectWorkflowOutputVar` array)
- Refresh logic sends `refreshOutputVarsList` message to update UI after adding variables
- Modal template function is included inline in client script to ensure proper scope availability
- CSS styling now matches forms implementation for consistent user experience

2025-08-23  GeneralFlow vs PageInit parity pass
- Command: Align general flow details view behavior with page init details view
- Changes: Injected forms' formControlUtilities into generalFlow client script to provide updateInputStyle/setupSettingsInputHandlers; unified copy-name UX to use icon swap like page init; no API changes
- Status: Completed
- Notes: General flow now mirrors page init interaction patterns; no schema or provider changes required

2025-08-23  refresh-view parity (generalFlow)
- Change: Updated refresh command flow to track, close, and reopen open General Flow details panels just like Page Init panels during appdna.refreshView. Preserves user context across a full refresh.
- Files: src/commands/registerCommands.ts
- Rationale: Ensure General Flow details view behaves the same as Page Init when the tree refresh icon is clicked.
- Status: Completed.

2025-08-24  output-var-move-buttons-fix (generalFlow)
- Change: Fixed non-working "Move Up" and "Move Down" buttons on General Flow output variables tab by adding missing click event handlers, refreshOutputVarsList function, and updateMoveButtonStates function.
- Files: src/webviews/generalFlow/components/templates/clientScriptTemplate.js
- Rationale: General Flow was missing the move button functionality that Page Init has - buttons existed in HTML but had no event handlers or state management.
- Status: Completed.

2025-08-24  params-move-buttons-fix (generalFlow)
- Change: Fixed non-working "Move Up" and "Move Down" buttons on General Flow input vars (params) tab by adding missing click event handlers, refreshParamsList function, and button state management for params list.
- Files: src/webviews/generalFlow/components/templates/clientScriptTemplate.js
- Rationale: Same issue as output vars - params move buttons existed in HTML but had no functionality. Now both params and output vars have complete move/reverse functionality matching Forms and Page Init patterns.
- Status: Completed.

2025-08-24  reverse-buttons-refresh-fix (generalFlow)
- Change: Fixed reverse buttons for both params and output vars not updating tree view after reverse operation by adding missing vscode.commands.executeCommand("appdna.refresh") calls to reverseParamArray and reverseOutputVarArray functions.
- Files: src/webviews/generalFlow/generalFlowDetailsView.js
- Rationale: The reverse operations were working but not triggering tree refresh like other operations (add, move). Tree wasn't updating to reflect the new order visually.
- Status: Completed.

2025-08-24  reverse-buttons-parity-fix (generalFlow)
- Change: Corrected reverse button behavior to match Page Init patterns by removing vscode.commands.executeCommand("appdna.refresh") calls from reverseParamArray and reverseOutputVarArray functions, keeping only webview postMessage for list refresh.
- Files: src/webviews/generalFlow/generalFlowDetailsView.js
- Rationale: Page Init's move/reverse operations only send webview refresh messages, not tree refresh commands. General Flow should follow the same pattern for consistency.
- Status: Completed.

2025-08-24  duplicate-event-handlers-fix (generalFlow)
- Change: Fixed double-reverse issue caused by duplicate event handlers by removing General Flow's move/reverse button handlers and letting Forms module handle them. Updated backend to handle both Forms and General Flow message formats.
- Files: src/webviews/generalFlow/components/templates/clientScriptTemplate.js, src/webviews/generalFlow/generalFlowDetailsView.js
- Rationale: General Flow was importing Forms' button handlers AND adding its own, causing double-click effects. Forms handlers work correctly when backend supports both message formats.
- Status: Completed.
