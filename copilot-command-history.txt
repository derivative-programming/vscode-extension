Command: Fix user story dev view details tab - devFilePath error
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
When setting priority (or other fields) on a user story in the dev view details 
tab, the extension was throwing an error:
  "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'devFilePath')"

ROOT CAUSE:
The webview scripts were sending messages to the extension in the wrong format:
- Webview was sending: { command: 'saveDevChange', storyId: X, changes: {...} }
- Extension expected: { command: 'saveDevChange', data: { complete dev record } }

The extension handler at userStoriesDevCommands.ts line 447 was accessing 
`message.data.devFilePath`, but the data property didn't exist because the 
webview wasn't wrapping the payload correctly.

SOLUTION:
1. Created a helper function `buildDevRecord(item)` in userStoryDevView.js that 
   builds a complete dev record with all required fields including devFilePath

2. Updated 6 webview script files to use this helper function:
   - priorityManagement.js (handlePriorityChange)
   - devStatusManagement.js (handleDevStatusChange)
   - modalFunctionality.js (saveStoryDetails)
   - storyPointsManagement.js (handleStoryPointsChange)
   - assignmentManagement.js (handleDeveloperAssignment, handleSprintAssignment)

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- The devFilePath is sent to the webview as part of each item in the initial data
- Each item in allItems array contains all dev record fields including devFilePath
- All single-item save operations must send the COMPLETE dev record, not partial changes
- The extension rebuilds the entire record and saves it to the dev file
- Bulk operations use separate commands (bulkUpdateDevStatus, etc.) and don't need devFilePath in each item

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/userStoryDevView.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/priorityManagement.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/devStatusManagement.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/modalFunctionality.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/storyPointsManagement.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/assignmentManagement.js

TESTING RECOMMENDATION:
Test all single-field changes in the details tab:
- Priority dropdown
- Dev Status dropdown
- Story Points dropdown
- Developer assignment
- Sprint assignment
- Edit modal (all fields)
