COMMAND: Fix MCP Tools for User Stories Role Requirements and Requirements Fulfillment Views
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

TASK:
Fix existing MCP tool and create new MCP tool for two separate views that were confused:
1. User Stories Role Requirements View - shows RBAC requirements per user story
2. Requirements Fulfillment View - shows fulfillment status across model

ISSUES FOUND:
1. MCP tool `open_user_stories_role_requirements_view` was incorrectly calling
   `appdna.showRequirementsFulfillment` command
2. No MCP tool existed for the Requirements Fulfillment view
3. These are TWO SEPARATE VIEWS with different purposes
4. Documentation was incomplete/incorrect in multiple files

CHANGES MADE:
Files Modified:
1. src/mcp/server.ts
   - Fixed existing tool description (line ~1111) to clarify it's for role requirements per story
   - Changed command call from `showRequirementsFulfillment` to `showRoleRequirements`
   - Added new tool `open_requirements_fulfillment_view` (line ~1138)
   - Both tools have no tabs (inputSchema is empty)
   - TOTAL TOOL COUNT: 63 tools (was 62)

2. src/mcp/tools/viewTools.ts
   - Updated comment for openUserStoriesRoleRequirements() method
   - Added new openRequirementsFulfillment() method

3. src/commands/mcpViewCommands.ts
   - Fixed command `appdna.mcp.openUserStoriesRoleRequirements`:
     Changed from: appdna.showUserStoryRoleRequirements
     Changed to: appdna.showRoleRequirements (which opens "User Stories - Role Requirements")
   - Added new command `appdna.mcp.openRequirementsFulfillment` calling appdna.showRequirementsFulfillment

4. README.md
   - Updated tool count from 62 to 63 in all references

5. MCP_README.md
   - Updated User Story Views section from 6 to 7 tools
   - Clarified descriptions for both tools

6. docs/VIEWS-REFERENCE.md
   - Fixed incorrect command mapping for userStoryRoleRequirementsView.js
   - Added missing entry for requirementsFulfillmentView.js
   - Corrected tab information (both views have no tabs)

7. docs/MCP-VIEW-COMMANDS-REFERENCE.md
   - Updated description for open_user_stories_role_requirements_view
   - Added new entry for open_requirements_fulfillment_view

8. src/extension.ts
   - Added open_requirements_fulfillment_view to chat mode tools list
   - Chat mode now includes all 63 MCP tools

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- User Stories Role Requirements View: userStoryRoleRequirementsView.js
  * Title: "User Story - Role Requirements" (singular)
  * Shows which roles are required to access/complete each user story
  * RBAC-focused per-story view
  * Command: appdna.showUserStoryRoleRequirements → appdna.showRoleRequirements → appdna.roleRequirements
  
- Requirements Fulfillment View: requirementsFulfillmentView.js
  * Title: "Requirements Fulfillment" 
  * Shows fulfillment status across user stories, data objects, journeys
  * Tracks fulfilled vs unfulfilled role requirements
  * Cross-cutting view of entire model
  * Command: appdna.showRequirementsFulfillment

- Neither view has tabs (verified via grep search)
- Command flow: MCP tool → viewTools → mcpViewCommands → actual view command
- Three similar but distinct commands existed:
  * appdna.showUserStoryRoleRequirements (singular - wrong one)
  * appdna.showRoleRequirements (delegates to appdna.roleRequirements - correct one)
  * appdna.showRequirementsFulfillment (completely separate view)

VERIFICATION:
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Webpack bundling successful  
✅ Both MCP tools now call correct commands
✅ All documentation updated (5 files)
✅ Tool count updated from 62 to 63
✅ Clear separation of concerns between the two views

DATE: October 18, 2025
COMMAND: Review and fix user stories list view MCP tool tabs documentation
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

TASK:
Review the MCP tool for viewing user stories list view and the tab switching 
functionality. The user stories list view shows tabs: Stories, Details, Role Distribution.

ISSUES FOUND:
1. MCP tool description in server.ts had incorrect tab values:
   - Said "all" instead of "stories"
   - Said "roleAccess" instead of "analytics"
   - Missing "details" tab documentation

2. Tab descriptions were wrong:
   - Said "Role-Based Access (security requirements)" 
   - Should be "Role Distribution (analytics showing role distribution charts)"

CHANGES MADE:
File: src/mcp/server.ts (line ~964)
- Fixed tool description to list correct tabs: "Stories", "Details", "Role Distribution"
- Updated initialTab parameter values: "stories", "details", "analytics"
- Corrected tab descriptions to match actual implementation

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- User Stories view implemented in: src/webviews/userStoriesView.js
- Has 3 tabs with data-tab attributes: "stories", "details", "analytics"
- Tab switching handled by switchTab() function
- MCP command handler in: src/commands/mcpViewCommands.ts (had correct values)
- Documentation reference: docs/VIEWS-REFERENCE.md

VERIFICATION:
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
✅ Tab values now match actual webview implementation
✅ Descriptions accurately reflect tab functionality

DATE: October 18, 2025
COMMAND: Update user stories dev view MCP tool tabs documentation
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

TASK:
Update the MCP tool for the User Stories Development view to reflect the actual
8 tabs shown in the interface (screenshot provided by user).

ISSUES FOUND:
1. MCP tool description had completely wrong tab names:
   - Said: "Dev Queue", "All Stories", "Dev Metrics", "Dev History", "Dev Forecast", 
     "Dev Bottlenecks", "Dev Distribution", "Dev Trends"
   - Reality: "Details", "Dev Queue", "Board", "Sprint", "Developers", "Forecast", "Cost", "Analysis"

2. Tab parameter values were incorrect:
   - Said: "devQueue", "all", "devMetrics", "devHistory", "devForecast", 
     "devBottlenecks", "devDistribution", "devTrends"
   - Should be: "details", "devQueue", "board", "sprint", "developers", "forecast", "cost", "analysis"

ACTUAL TAB STRUCTURE (from screenshot and code):
1. Details - 13-column table with filters and bulk operations
2. Dev Queue - Drag-and-drop priority queue
3. Board - Kanban board with 5 status columns
4. Sprint - Sprint planning and burndown chart
5. Developers - Developer management and capacity planning
6. Forecast - Gantt chart timeline with working hours
7. Cost - Monthly cost analysis by developer
8. Analysis - 6 KPIs and 5 D3.js charts

CHANGES MADE:
File: src/mcp/server.ts (line ~994)
- Updated tool description with correct 8 tabs and accurate descriptions
- Fixed initialTab parameter values to match actual onclick="switchTab(...)" values
- Updated inputSchema description with correct tab names

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- User Stories Dev view implemented in: src/webviews/userStoryDev/userStoryDevView.js
- HTML structure in: src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts (line ~4674)
- Tab switching uses onclick="switchTab('tabName')" pattern
- Tab content divs use id="{tabName}Tab" pattern
- 8 tabs with values: "details", "devQueue", "board", "sprint", "developers", "forecast", "cost", "analysis"

VERIFICATION:
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
✅ Tab values match actual HTML onclick attributes
✅ Tab order matches screenshot: Details, Dev Queue, Board, Sprint, Developers, Forecast, Cost, Analysis
✅ Descriptions accurately reflect each tab's purpose

DATE: October 18, 2025
COMMAND: Update user stories journey view MCP tool tabs documentation
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

TASK:
Update the MCP tool for the User Stories Journey view to reflect the actual 7 tabs
shown in the interface (screenshot provided by user).

ISSUES FOUND:
1. MCP tool description was too generic and didn't list tabs:
   - Said: "Shows the flow of user stories across different stages..."
   - No tab information provided
   - No mention of multiple tabs or analytics features

2. mcpViewCommands.ts had completely wrong tab information:
   - Said: 'journey' (visual journey map), 'list' (list view of journeys)
   - Reality: 7 completely different tabs for analytics and visualization

3. No initialTab parameter support (correctly documented as not supported)

ACTUAL TAB STRUCTURE (from code and screenshot):
1. User Stories - Story-page mappings with journey distances
2. Page Usage - Usage frequency table
3. Page Usage Treemap - Visual size representation by usage
4. Page Usage Distribution - Histogram of usage patterns
5. Page Usage vs Complexity - Scatter plot analysis (4 quadrants)
6. Journey Visualization - Treemap of journey complexity
7. Journey Distribution - Histogram of complexity categories

CHANGES MADE:
Files: src/mcp/server.ts (line ~1054), src/commands/mcpViewCommands.ts (line ~51)
- Updated tool description with complete list of all 7 tabs and their purposes
- Fixed mcpViewCommands.ts comments to list correct tab values
- Documented that initialTab parameter is not supported
- Added detailed descriptions for each tab's functionality

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- User Stories Journey view implemented in: src/webviews/userStoriesJourneyView.js
- HTML structure in: src/commands/userStoriesJourneyCommands.ts (line ~2878)
- Tab switching uses data-tab attribute pattern
- Tab content divs use id="{tabName}-tab" pattern
- 7 tabs with values: "user-stories", "page-usage", "page-usage-treemap", 
  "page-usage-distribution", "page-usage-vs-complexity", "journey-visualization", "journey-distribution"
- NO initialTab parameter support (view always opens on first tab)

VERIFICATION:
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
✅ Tab names match actual HTML data-tab attributes
✅ All 7 tabs documented with accurate descriptions
✅ Correctly noted that initialTab is not supported

===============================================================================

DATE: October 18, 2025
COMMAND: Implement tab switching support for user stories journey view
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

TASK:
Implement the initialTab parameter support for the User Stories Journey view
to enable MCP tools to open specific tabs programmatically.

IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN:
Following the same successful pattern from User Stories List and Dev views:
1. Add initialTab parameter to command registration
2. Add postMessage for both new and existing panels
3. Add message handler in webview JavaScript
4. Update MCP tool and viewTools to support parameter

CHANGES MADE:

1. File: src/commands/userStoriesJourneyCommands.ts (line ~1200)
   - Updated command registration to accept initialTab parameter
   - Added postMessage for existing panels (reveal + switchToTab)
   - Added postMessage for new panels after HTML is set
   - Added console logging for debugging

2. File: src/webviews/userStoriesJourneyView.js (line ~1365)
   - Added 'switchToTab' case in message handler
   - Uses querySelector to find tab button by data-tab attribute
   - Simulates button click to trigger tab switching
   - Includes console logging for debugging

3. File: src/commands/mcpViewCommands.ts (line ~51)
   - Updated to pass initialTab parameter to command
   - Updated comments to document all 7 tab values
   - Removed "initialTab not supported" note

4. File: src/mcp/tools/viewTools.ts (line ~106)
   - Updated openUserStoriesJourney to accept initialTab parameter
   - Follows same pattern as openUserStoriesDev

5. File: src/mcp/server.ts (line ~1054)
   - Updated tool description to document initialTab support
   - Added inputSchema with initialTab parameter
   - Updated outputSchema to include initialTab
   - Removed "does not support initialTab" note

TAB VALUES SUPPORTED:
✅ "user-stories" - Story-page mappings with journey distances
✅ "page-usage" - Usage frequency table
✅ "page-usage-treemap" - Visual size representation by usage
✅ "page-usage-distribution" - Histogram of usage patterns
✅ "page-usage-vs-complexity" - Scatter plot analysis (4 quadrants)
✅ "journey-visualization" - Treemap of journey complexity
✅ "journey-distribution" - Histogram of complexity categories

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Uses data-tab attribute pattern for tab identification
- Tab switching via button.click() simulation
- Message passing pattern: extension → webview → switchTab
- Works for both new panels and existing (revealed) panels
- Same implementation pattern as userStoriesView and userStoryDevView

VERIFICATION:
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
✅ No webpack errors
✅ Tab values match HTML data-tab attributes
✅ Message handler follows established pattern
✅ MCP tool updated with correct parameters
✅ ViewTools method signature matches other views
