- Status: No changes needed - the feature is already complete and working

Command: Implement auto-refresh functionality for Model Fabrication request view  
- Task: Add auto-refresh functionality similar to Model AI Processing and Model Validation views that activates when there are processing or queued requests, refreshes every minute, and displays "Auto-refreshing every minute" text with spinning icon
- Investigation: Analyzed existing Model Fabrication view code in modelFabricationView.js
- Finding: Auto-refresh functionality was NOT implemented in the Model Fabrication view
- Implementation: Added complete auto-refresh functionality including:
  * Added autoRefreshTimer variable and AUTO_REFRESH_INTERVAL constant (60000ms)
  * Added checkAndSetAutoRefresh() function to manage timer setup/clearing
  * Added isProcessingOrQueued() function to detect "Queued" and "Processing" states
  * Added updateAutoRefreshIndicator() function for UI indicator with spinning icon
  * Added CSS animations for spinning sync icon (#autoRefreshIndicator .fa-sync-alt)
  * Added auto-refresh activation after data loads via checkAndSetAutoRefresh() call
  * Added proper cleanup on window unload
  * Added auto-refresh indicator container styling

- Added validatePendingRequests() function in JavaScript to send validation command to extension
- Added event listener for the validate button click
- Enhanced header description to explain validation process and "out of date" marking
- Found that validation functionality was already implemented but needed UI exposure:
  * validatePendingChangeRequests() in changeRequestsListView.ts performs validation

- Modified objectCommands.ts to call modelService.markUnsavedChanges() when adding a data object
- Updated ai-agent-architecture-notes.md to document this change
- Fixed ReferenceError: downloadButton is not defined error in showDetailsModal function
- Moved downloadButton variable declaration outside the if block to make it accessible throughout the function scope
