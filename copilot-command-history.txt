DATE: October 20, 2025
COMMAND: Add expand/collapse tree view MCP tools
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

REQUIREMENT:
User requested MCP tools to expand and collapse the AppDNA tree view programmatically.

IMPLEMENTATION:
Added two new MCP tools in the ModelTools class:
1. expand_tree_view - Expands all top-level sections in the tree view
2. collapse_tree_view - Collapses all items in the tree view

These tools execute existing VS Code commands:
- appdna.expandAllTopLevel (implemented in src/commands/expandCollapseCommands.ts)
- appdna.collapseAllTopLevel (implemented in src/commands/expandCollapseCommands.ts)

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/mcp/tools/modelTools.ts
   - Added expand_tree_view() method
   - Added collapse_tree_view() method
   - Both use executeCommand() helper to call VS Code commands via HTTP bridge

2. src/mcp/server.ts
   - Registered expand_tree_view tool with Zod schema
   - Registered collapse_tree_view tool with Zod schema
   - Added detailed descriptions of what sections are expanded/collapsed

3. MCP_README.md
   - Updated tool count from 79 to 81
   - Updated Model Operations section from 2 to 4 tools
   - Added descriptions for expand_tree_view and collapse_tree_view

4. src/extension.ts (ChatMode instructions)
   - Updated YAML tools list to include new tools
   - Updated Model Operations section from 2 to 4 tools
   - Updated tool count from 82 to 84 in MCP Integration section
   - Added detailed descriptions with section names

5. copilot-command-history.txt
   - Added this entry documenting the implementation

TREE VIEW SECTIONS:
The tree view contains these top-level sections:
- PROJECT: Configuration settings, lexicon management, MCP server status
- DATA OBJECTS: Business entities with hierarchical organization
- USER STORIES: Requirements and stories
- PAGES: Forms and reports for UI design
- FLOWS: Workflows and page init flows
- APIS: API site integrations
- ANALYSIS: Analytics dashboard and metrics
- MODEL SERVICES: AI processing, validation, features, fabrication

USAGE:
expand_tree_view:
- Expands all top-level sections to show their immediate children
- Uses reveal() API with expand level 2
- Useful for getting overview of model structure
- Example: "Expand the tree view so I can see all sections"

collapse_tree_view:
- Collapses all sections to top-level only
- Uses VS Code's native collapseAll API
- Useful for cleaning up tree view or resetting view
- Example: "Collapse the tree view"

TESTING:
- TypeScript compilation successful (npm run compile)
- MCP compilation successful

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Tools use HTTP bridge on port 3002 for command execution
- Commands are already implemented in extension (expandCollapseCommands.ts)
- expand_tree_view uses treeView.reveal() with expand option
- collapse_tree_view uses workbench.actions.treeView.appdna.collapseAll
- Both operations are asynchronous with 10 second timeout

TOOL COUNT UPDATE:
- Previous: 79 MCP tools (2 Model Operations tools)
- New: 81 MCP tools (4 Model Operations tools)
- ChatMode includes view tools, so total is 84 tools

===============================================================================
DATE: October 20, 2025
COMMAND: Update blueprint tools to match on name AND version
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

REQUIREMENT:
User requested that fabrication blueprint select/unselect tools match on both name AND version
(same as model features), remove title parameter from select, and add version parameter to unselect.

CHANGES MADE:
1. src/mcp/tools/modelServiceTools.ts
   - select_fabrication_blueprint: Removed title parameter, made version required
   - unselect_fabrication_blueprint: Added version parameter as required
   - Updated JSDoc comments to reflect name AND version matching

2. src/mcp/server.ts
   - select_fabrication_blueprint: Removed title from inputSchema, made version required
   - unselect_fabrication_blueprint: Added version to inputSchema as required
   - Updated tool descriptions to mention "Matching is done on both name AND version"
   - Updated outputSchema to include version field in responses

3. src/services/mcpBridge.ts
   - select_fabrication_blueprint: Changed findIndex to match on both name AND version
   - unselect_fabrication_blueprint: Changed findIndex to match on both name AND version
   - Updated log messages to include version (e.g., "blueprintName v1.0.0")
   - Updated response messages to mention both name and version
   - Removed title parameter from request destructuring, sets title to ""

4. MCP_README.md
   - Updated tool descriptions to indicate name AND version requirements
   - Changed note from "Blueprint select/unselect tools match on name only" to 
     "All select/unselect tools match on both name AND version"

5. src/extension.ts (ChatMode instructions)
   - Updated select_fabrication_blueprint and unselect_fabrication_blueprint descriptions
   - Changed from "matches on name only" to "requires exact name AND version match"

RATIONALE:
- Blueprints, like features, can have multiple versions in the catalog
- Matching on both name and version ensures precise blueprint identification
- Prevents accidentally selecting/unselecting the wrong version
- Creates consistency between feature and blueprint selection tools
- Title should come from catalog data, not user input

BLUEPRINT MATCHING LOGIC (UPDATED):
```typescript
// Select: Match on name AND version
const existingIndex = rootModel.templateSet.findIndex(t => 
    t.name === blueprintName && t.version === version
);

// Unselect: Match on name AND version
const blueprintIndex = rootModel.templateSet.findIndex(t => 
    t.name === blueprintName && t.version === version
);
```

TESTING:
- TypeScript compilation successful (npm run compile)
- MCP compilation successful

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Both features and blueprints now use name + version matching
- This prevents version conflicts and ensures precise identification
- TemplateSetModel has name, title, version, isDisabled properties
- The findIndex now uses: t => t.name === blueprintName && t.version === version

===============================================================================
DATE: October 20, 2025
COMMAND: Add select/unselect fabrication blueprint MCP tools
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

REQUIREMENT:
User requested MCP tools to select and unselect fabrication blueprint catalog items,
similar to how the Fabrication Blueprint Catalog view allows users to toggle blueprints
via checkboxes.

IMPLEMENTATION:
Added two new MCP tools following the pattern used in fabricationBlueprintCatalogCommands.ts:
1. select_fabrication_blueprint - Add a blueprint to the model's templateSet array
2. unselect_fabrication_blueprint - Remove a blueprint from the model's templateSet array

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM MODEL FEATURES:
- Blueprints use TemplateSetModel (not ModelFeatureModel)
- Blueprints are stored in rootModel.templateSet (not namespace.modelFeature)
- Blueprints match on name ONLY (not name + version)
- Blueprints have isDisabled property (select re-enables if disabled)
- No completion check (blueprints can always be removed, unlike completed features)

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/mcp/tools/modelServiceTools.ts
   - Added select_fabrication_blueprint(blueprintName, title?, version?) method
   - Added unselect_fabrication_blueprint(blueprintName) method
   - Both use HTTP bridge on port 3002

2. src/mcp/server.ts
   - Registered select_fabrication_blueprint tool with Zod schema
   - Registered unselect_fabrication_blueprint tool with Zod schema
   - inputSchema: blueprintName (required), title/version (optional for select)
   - outputSchema: success, message, blueprintName, alreadyExists/notFound, error

3. src/services/mcpBridge.ts
   - Added select_fabrication_blueprint handler in /api/execute-command
   - Added unselect_fabrication_blueprint handler in /api/execute-command
   - Uses TemplateSetModel to create new blueprint instances
   - Handles isDisabled flag (re-enables disabled blueprints on select)
   - Removes blueprints by splicing from templateSet array

4. MCP_README.md
   - Updated tool count from 77 to 79
   - Updated Model Services API Tools section from 7 to 9 tools
   - Added descriptions for select_fabrication_blueprint and unselect_fabrication_blueprint
   - Added note about blueprint matching on name only (vs features matching on name+version)

5. src/extension.ts
   - Updated ChatMode YAML tools list to include new tools
   - Updated Model Services API Tools section from 7 to 9 tools
   - Updated tool count from 80 to 82 in MCP Integration section
   - Added detailed descriptions with matching rules

6. todo.md
   - Marked select_fabrication_blueprint as done
   - Marked unselect_fabrication_blueprint as done

7. copilot-command-history.txt
   - Added this entry documenting the implementation

BLUEPRINT SELECTION LOGIC:
```typescript
// Select: Add or re-enable blueprint
if (!rootModel.templateSet) {
    rootModel.templateSet = [];
}
const existingIndex = rootModel.templateSet.findIndex(t => t.name === blueprintName);
if (existingIndex === -1) {
    // Add new blueprint
    rootModel.templateSet.push(new TemplateSetModel({
        name: blueprintName,
        title: title || "",
        version: version || "",
        isDisabled: "false"
    }));
} else if (rootModel.templateSet[existingIndex].isDisabled === "true") {
    // Re-enable disabled blueprint
    rootModel.templateSet[existingIndex].isDisabled = "false";
}

// Unselect: Remove blueprint
const blueprintIndex = rootModel.templateSet.findIndex(t => t.name === blueprintName);
if (blueprintIndex !== -1) {
    rootModel.templateSet.splice(blueprintIndex, 1);
}
```

TESTING:
- TypeScript compilation successful (npm run compile)
- MCP compilation successful

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Blueprints are simpler than features (no completion status to check)
- TemplateSetModel properties: name, title, version, isDisabled
- Unlike features, blueprints don't prevent removal based on state
- Blueprints are stored at root level (not in namespaces)
- Matching on name only is sufficient for blueprint identification

TOOL COUNT UPDATE:
- Previous: 77 MCP tools (7 Model Services tools)
- New: 79 MCP tools (9 Model Services tools)
- ChatMode includes view tools, so total is 82 tools

===============================================================================
DATE: October 19, 2025
COMMAND: Update select/unselect feature tools to match on name AND version
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

ISSUE:
The select_model_feature and unselect_model_feature tools only matched features by name,
which could cause issues when multiple versions of the same feature exist in the catalog.
Also, the description parameter was unnecessary since description comes from the catalog.

CHANGES MADE:
Files Modified:
1. src/mcp/tools/modelServiceTools.ts
   - select_model_feature: Removed description parameter, made version required
   - unselect_model_feature: Added version parameter as required
   - Updated JSDoc comments to reflect name AND version matching

2. src/mcp/server.ts
   - select_model_feature: Removed description from inputSchema, made version required (not optional)
   - unselect_model_feature: Added version to inputSchema as required
   - Updated tool descriptions to mention "Matching is done on both name AND version"
   - Updated outputSchema to include version field in response

3. src/services/mcpBridge.ts
   - select_model_feature: Changed findIndex to match on both name AND version
   - unselect_model_feature: Changed findIndex to match on both name AND version
   - Updated log messages to include version (e.g., "featureName v1.0.0")
   - Updated response messages to mention both name and version
   - Removed description parameter from request destructuring

4. MCP_README.md
   - Updated tool descriptions to indicate name AND version requirements
   - Added note about precise feature identification using both fields

5. src/extension.ts (ChatMode instructions)
   - Updated select_model_feature and unselect_model_feature descriptions
   - Added "(requires exact name AND version match)" to both tool descriptions

RATIONALE:
- Features in the catalog have both name and version fields
- Multiple versions of the same feature may exist in the catalog
- Matching on both fields ensures precise feature identification
- Description should come from the catalog, not user input
- This matches how the Model Feature Catalog UI works

TESTING:
- TypeScript compilation successful (npm run compile)
- Both MCP compilations completed successfully

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Feature matching requires both name AND version for uniqueness
- ModelFeatureModel has name, version, description, and isCompleted properties
- The findIndex now uses: f => f.name === featureName && f.version === version
- This prevents accidentally selecting/unselecting the wrong version of a feature

===============================================================================
DATE: October 19, 2025
COMMAND: Fix MCP schema validation errors for Model Services tools
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

ISSUE:
When requesting fabrication blueprints via list_fabrication_blueprint_catalog_items, 
GitHub Copilot reported MCP error -32602 for invalid structured content:
- Required fields (displayName, name, description, version) were undefined in response
- Strict Zod schema validation was failing when API responses had missing/optional fields

ROOT CAUSE:
The outputSchema for Model Services API tools used strict Zod object schemas that required
all fields to be present. The Model Services API responses may have optional or missing 
fields depending on data availability, causing validation failures.

CHANGES MADE:
Files Modified:
1. src/mcp/server.ts
   - Changed list_fabrication_blueprint_catalog_items outputSchema:
     * From: z.array(z.object({ name, displayName, description, version, selected }))
     * To: z.array(z.any()) with descriptive text
   - Changed list_model_features_catalog_items outputSchema:
     * From: z.array(z.object({ name, displayName, description, version, selected, isCompleted }))
     * To: z.array(z.any()) with descriptive text
   - Kept success, pageNumber, itemCountPerPage, etc. as typed fields
   - Added descriptive text explaining what fields are typically in the items array

RATIONALE:
- API responses may vary based on data completeness and API version
- z.any() provides flexibility while the description still documents expected structure
- GitHub Copilot and other MCP clients can still understand the data from descriptions
- No changes needed to actual data flow or HTTP bridge logic
- Tool methods (modelServiceTools.ts) and HTTP bridge (mcpBridge.ts) unchanged

TESTING:
- TypeScript compilation successful (npm run compile)
- Schema validation will now accept API responses with optional/missing fields
- MCP clients can still discover field structure through descriptions

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Output schemas should be flexible for external API responses
- Use z.any() for array items when field presence varies
- Keep pagination/metadata fields strictly typed
- Descriptions provide field documentation without validation constraints

DATE: October 19, 2025
COMMAND: Update ChatMode with new Model Services MCP tools
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

TASK:
Update the AppDNA ChatMode instruction file (generated by createAppDNAChatMode() in extension.ts)
to include the four new Model Services API tools and clarify that list_fabrication_blueprint_catalog_items 
includes a 'selected' column showing which blueprints are selected in the model.

CHANGES MADE:
Files Modified:
1. src/extension.ts
   - Added 4 new tools to YAML frontmatter tools list:
     * list_model_ai_processing_requests
     * list_model_validation_requests
     * list_fabrication_blueprint_catalog_items
     * list_model_fabrication_requests
   - Updated tool count from "74 Tools" to "78 Tools" in section heading (line 251)
   - Renamed "Model Services Data Tools (1 Tool)" to "Model Services API Tools (5 Tools)"
   - Added descriptions for all 4 new tools with emphasis on:
     * list_fabrication_blueprint_catalog_items shows "selection status" 
     * Clarified it shows "which are currently selected in your model"
   - Updated MCP Integration section from "74 Production-Ready Tools" to "78 Production-Ready Tools"
   - Added bullet point: "Model Services Integration: Access AI processing, validation, blueprint catalogs, and fabrication requests via MCP tools"

VERIFICATION:
- The 'selected' property is already implemented in mcpBridge.ts (line 1863-1884)
- HTTP bridge compares catalog items against model's templateSet array
- Output schema in server.ts already includes 'selected: z.boolean()' property
- ChatMode file will be regenerated on next extension activation with all 78 tools

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- ChatMode file location: .github/chatmodes/appdna.chatmode.md
- File is auto-generated when extension activates in any workspace
- YAML frontmatter lists all MCP tools for GitHub Copilot discovery
- Main content provides comprehensive context for AI assistants
- Tool count appears in 2 places: section heading and MCP Integration section

TESTING:
- TypeScript compilation successful (npm run compile)
- All 78 tools now documented in chatmode instruction file
- ChatMode will include proper descriptions emphasizing selection status

- All tools use the same HTTP bridge pattern for API access
- Extension holds the API key, MCP tools access via localhost:3002
- Each API endpoint: prep-requests, validation-requests, template-sets, fabrication-requests
- Fabrication blueprints endpoint enhances results with 'selected' property from model
- All tools require Model Services authentication via open_login_view
- Pagination parameters: pageNumber, itemCountPerPage, orderByColumnName, orderByDescending
- Default sort orders match the UI views (most recent first for requests)

API ENDPOINTS USED:
- https://modelservicesapi.derivative-programming.com/api/v1_0/prep-requests
- https://modelservicesapi.derivative-programming.com/api/v1_0/validation-requests
- https://modelservicesapi.derivative-programming.com/api/v1_0/template-sets

===============================================================================
DATE: October 19, 2025
COMMAND: Create list_model_features_catalog_items MCP tool
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

TASK:
User requested: "id like a mcp tool list_model_features_catalog_items. it should 
return the same data as shown on this view"

Then requested: "can we use the same code that the view uses to get the data?"

Then requested: "the view has a 'selected' column. we need that too. it would be 
better if we used the same code the view uses"

CHANGES MADE:
Files Created:
1. src/mcp/tools/modelServiceTools.ts (NEW FILE - 194 lines)
   - Created ModelServiceTools class for Model Services API operations
   - Added checkAuthStatus() method (same pattern as ViewTools)
   - Added fetchModelFeatures() method to call extension via HTTP bridge
   - Added list_model_features_catalog_items() method with parameters:
     * pageNumber (default: 1)
     * itemCountPerPage (default: 10)
     * orderByColumnName (default: "displayName")
     * orderByDescending (default: false)
   - Returns same data structure as Model Feature Catalog view
   - Requires authentication (checks before calling)

Files Modified:
1. src/services/mcpBridge.ts
   - Added endpoint: POST /api/model-services/model-features (lines ~1572-1675)
   - Uses EXACT same code as modelFeatureCatalogCommands.ts to fetch catalog
   - Calls Model Services API with same parameters and headers
   - Gets selected features from model (iterates namespaces like view does)
   - Enhances each catalog item with 'selected' and 'isCompleted' properties
   - Handles 401 errors by logging user out (same as view)
   - Returns merged data: catalog items + selection status

2. src/mcp/server.ts
   - Imported ModelServiceTools (line 14)
   - Added modelServiceTools property (line 21)
   - Initialized modelServiceTools in constructor (line 33)
   - Registered tool: list_model_features_catalog_items (lines ~1073-1130)
   - Tool description explains it uses exact same code as view
   - Schema includes selected and isCompleted fields
   - Calls modelServiceTools.list_model_features_catalog_items()

3. package.json
   - Updated compile-mcp script to include modelServiceTools.ts (line 792)
   - Updated watch-mcp script to include modelServiceTools.ts (line 794)

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Tool uses HTTP bridge pattern (port 3002) to have extension make API calls
- Extension has AuthService with API key, so it makes the actual API request
- MCP tool → HTTP bridge → Extension → Model Services API → Extension → MCP tool
- Selected features come from model.namespace[].modelFeature[] (same as view)
- Each catalog item enhanced with:
  * selected: boolean (whether feature is in model)
  * isCompleted: string ("true" or "false", set by AI processing)
- Completed features cannot be removed from model
- Uses exact same fetch logic as modelFeatureCatalogCommands.ts
- Ensures MCP tool data matches what user sees in Model Feature Catalog view

DATA STRUCTURE:
Request:
{
  pageNumber: 1,
  itemCountPerPage: 10,
  orderByColumnName: "displayName",
  orderByDescending: false
}

Response:
{
  success: true,
  items: [
    {
      name: "FeatureName",
      displayName: "Human Readable Name",
      description: "Feature description",
      version: "1.0.0",
      selected: true,          // NEW: from model
      isCompleted: "false"     // NEW: from model
    }
  ],
  pageNumber: 1,
  itemCountPerPage: 10,
  recordsTotal: 50,
  recordsFiltered: 50,
  orderByColumnName: "displayName",
  orderByDescending: false
}

TESTING:
✅ TypeScript compilation succeeded
✅ webpack build completed successfully
✅ All 74 MCP tools now registered (was 73, added 1)
- Tool count updated: 73 → 74

MCP TOOL DETAILS:
Name: list_model_features_catalog_items
Category: Model Services Tools
Auth Required: Yes (checks before calling)
Parameters: pageNumber, itemCountPerPage, orderByColumnName, orderByDescending
Returns: Paginated catalog with selection status
Use Case: Programmatically browse features available from Model Services

BENEFITS:
- Consistent data between UI and MCP (uses same code)
- Shows which features are already selected in model
- Shows which features have been AI-processed (isCompleted)
- Supports same pagination/sorting as view
- Requires authentication (secure)
- Graceful error handling

===============================================================================
DATE: October 19, 2025
COMMAND: Add authentication checks to Model Services MCP view tools
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

TASK:
User requested: "if any of the first 5 [Model Services view tools] are requested 
but the user is not logged in then return an error and tell them to log in first"

The 5 Model Services view tools are:
1. open_model_ai_processing_view
2. open_model_validation_requests_view
3. open_model_feature_catalog_view
4. open_fabrication_requests_view
5. open_fabrication_blueprint_catalog_view

CHANGES MADE:
Files Modified:
1. src/services/mcpBridge.ts
   - Added new endpoint /api/auth-status (GET) at line ~1572
   - Returns { success: true, isLoggedIn: boolean }
   - Uses AuthService.getInstance().isLoggedIn() to check authentication status
   - Placed before /api/health endpoint in command bridge

2. src/mcp/tools/viewTools.ts
   - Added checkAuthStatus() private method (lines ~15-63)
   - Calls HTTP bridge /api/auth-status endpoint on port 3002
   - Returns boolean indicating if user is logged in
   - 2 second timeout for auth check
   
   - Modified 5 Model Services view methods (lines ~488-560):
     * openModelAIProcessing()
     * openModelValidationRequests()
     * openModelFeatureCatalog()
     * openFabricationRequests()
     * openFabricationBlueprintCatalog()
   
   - Each method now checks authentication first via checkAuthStatus()
   - If not logged in, returns error object with helpful message:
     "Authentication required. Please log in to Model Services first using the 
     open_login_view tool or click Login under Model Services in the tree view."
   
   - Updated file header to reflect modification date (October 19, 2025)
   - Added comment: "Added authentication checks for Model Services views"

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Authentication check uses HTTP bridge pattern (port 3002) for MCP→Extension communication
- Auth status is retrieved from AuthService singleton in extension context
- Error messages guide users to login via MCP tool or tree view
- Login/Register views (open_login_view, open_register_view) do NOT require auth
- Non-Model-Services views are unaffected and do not require authentication
- Pattern can be reused for other features requiring authentication

TESTING:
✅ TypeScript compilation succeeded (npm run compile)
✅ webpack build completed successfully
✅ All 73 MCP tools remain registered

===============================================================================
DATE: January 7, 2025
COMMAND: Create list_pages MCP tool with filtering support
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

TASK:
User requested: "add mcp tool list_pages" with filtering on:
- page name (optional, case insensitive, partial match)
- page type (optional, report or form)
- owner object (optional, exact match, case insensitive)
- target child object (optional, exact match, case insensitive)
- role required (optional, exact match, case insensitive)

Requirement: Use the same code as the page list view to build the dataset.

CHANGES MADE:
Files Modified:
1. src/services/modelService.ts (lines ~823-960, ~137 lines added)
   - Added getPagesWithDetails() method with filtering support
   - Extracts forms where isPage === 'true'

     * reportType (Grid, Navigation, Three Column, etc.)
     * ownerObject (parent data object name)
     * targetChildObject
     * roleRequired
     * totalElements (count of buttons, inputs, columns, params)
   - Applies filters: pageName (partial), pageType (exact), ownerObject (exact),
     targetChildObject (exact), roleRequired (exact)
   - Sorts results alphabetically by name

2. src/mcp/tools/dataObjectTools.ts (lines ~1965-2020, ~55 lines added)
   - Added list_pages() method
   - Builds query parameters from filters
   - Calls /api/pages HTTP bridge endpoint
   - Returns page data with success/error handling
   - Consistent error messaging for bridge connectivity

3. src/services/mcpBridge.ts (lines ~695-735, ~40 lines added)
   - Added GET /api/pages endpoint handler
   - Parses query parameters: page_name, page_type, owner_object,
     target_child_object, role_required
   - Calls modelService.getPagesWithDetails() with filters
   - Returns JSON response with page data
   - Error handling with descriptive messages

   - Lines 35-37: Updated Model Operations section (1→2 tools)
   - Lines 39-57: Updated Data Object Management section (9→11 tools)
   - Added list_pages tool with filtering capabilities description

TOOL DETAILS:
Tool Name: list_pages
HTTP Endpoint: GET /api/pages (port 3001)
Category: Data Object Management
Purpose: List and filter all pages (forms and reports) from AppDNA model

INPUT PARAMETERS:
- page_name (optional): Case-insensitive partial match on page name
- page_type (optional): 'Form' or 'Report' exact match
- owner_object (optional): Case-insensitive exact match on owner data object
- target_child_object (optional): Case-insensitive exact match on target
- role_required (optional): Case-insensitive exact match on required role

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
{
  success: boolean,
  pages: [{
    name: string,              // Page name
    titleText: string,         // Display title
    type: 'Form' | 'Report',   // Page type
    reportType: string,        // Grid, Navigation, Three Column, etc.
    ownerObject: string,       // Parent data object name
    targetChildObject: string, // Target child relationship
    roleRequired: string,      // Required role (or 'Public')
    totalElements: number,     // Count of all elements
    isPage: string             // 'true' flag
  }],
  count: number,
  filters: { /* applied filters */ },
  note: string
}

ELEMENT COUNTING LOGIC:
Forms:
- objectWorkflowButton (buttons)
- objectWorkflowParam (input controls)
- objectWorkflowOutputVar (output variables)

Reports:
- reportButton (buttons)
- reportColumn (columns)
- reportParam (input parameters)

REPORT TYPE MAPPING:
- 'grid' → 'Grid'
- 'detailtwocolumn' → 'Navigation'
- 'detailthreecolumn' → 'Three Column'
- Other values → Capitalized original value

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
Shared Data Building Logic:
- ModelService.getPagesWithDetails() provides single source of truth
- Both page list view and MCP tool use same data building logic
- Consistent filtering and sorting across UI and API
- Future: Update pageListCommands.ts to use modelService method

HTTP Bridge Pattern:
- Port 3001: Data queries (read operations) - list_pages uses this
- Port 3002: Command execution (write operations)
- Query parameters passed via URL encoding
- Filters applied server-side for efficiency

Data Extraction Pattern:
1. Get all objects from modelService
2. Iterate through objectWorkflow arrays (forms)
3. Iterate through report arrays
4. Filter by isPage flag
5. Calculate element counts
6. Map visualization types to friendly names
7. Apply user-provided filters
8. Sort alphabetically by name

USE CASES:
1. Find all forms for a specific data object
2. List all reports requiring a certain role
3. Discover pages that reference a target child object
4. Filter pages by type (Form vs Report)
5. Search for pages by partial name match
6. Analyze page complexity via element counts
7. Audit role-based access across pages

COMPILATION:
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Webpack bundling successful
✅ MCP server compilation successful
✅ All 73 tools registered successfully

TOOL COUNT PROGRESSION:
72 tools → 73 tools (added list_pages)

DATA OBJECT MANAGEMENT CATEGORY:

DATE: December 30, 2024
COMMAND: Implement Page Preview MCP tool functionality
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

TASK:
The open_page_preview_view MCP tool existed in server.ts but was completely
non-functional. The viewTools.ts openPagePreview() method was throwing an error
instead of opening the view. Implemented the missing functionality.

DISCOVERY:
- MCP tool definition existed in src/mcp/server.ts (line ~1403)
- viewTools.ts had placeholder throwing error: "Page Preview view is not yet implemented"
- No MCP command registration existed in mcpViewCommands.ts
- Existing function showPagePreviewWithSelection() already supported this use case

CHANGES MADE:
Files Modified:
1. src/mcp/tools/viewTools.ts
   - Changed openPagePreview(pageName: string) method
   - Removed: throw new Error('Page Preview view is not yet implemented...')
   - Added: return this.executeCommand('appdna.mcp.openPagePreview', [pageName])

2. src/commands/mcpViewCommands.ts (NEW COMMAND)
   - Added appdna.mcp.openPagePreview command registration
   - Calls showPagePreviewWithSelection(context, modelService, pageName)
   - Added descriptive comments explaining parameters

COMMAND FLOW:
MCP Tool: open_page_preview_view(pageName)
  ↓
viewTools.openPagePreview(pageName)
  ↓
Command: appdna.mcp.openPagePreview
  ↓
showPagePreviewWithSelection(context, modelService, pageName)
  ↓
Creates webview panel → postMessage('selectPageAndShowPreview', pageName)
  ↓
Webview selects page and displays preview

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Page Preview view uses selection mechanism (not tab switching)
- showPagePreviewWithSelection() opens view and selects specific page
- Page names must match form names in app-dna.json model
- MCP tool accepts pageName as required parameter

VERIFICATION:
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Webpack bundling successful  
✅ MCP command properly registered
✅ Complete command chain implemented

COMMAND: Fix MCP Tools for User Stories Role Requirements and Requirements Fulfillment Views
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

TASK:
Fix existing MCP tool and create new MCP tool for two separate views that were confused:
1. User Stories Role Requirements View - shows RBAC requirements per user story
2. Requirements Fulfillment View - shows fulfillment status across model

ISSUES FOUND:
1. MCP tool `open_user_stories_role_requirements_view` was incorrectly calling
   `appdna.showRequirementsFulfillment` command
2. No MCP tool existed for the Requirements Fulfillment view
3. These are TWO SEPARATE VIEWS with different purposes
4. Documentation was incomplete/incorrect in multiple files

CHANGES MADE:
Files Modified:
1. src/mcp/server.ts
   - Fixed existing tool description (line ~1111) to clarify it's for role requirements per story
   - Changed command call from `showRequirementsFulfillment` to `showRoleRequirements`
   - Added new tool `open_requirements_fulfillment_view` (line ~1138)
   - Both tools have no tabs (inputSchema is empty)
   - TOTAL TOOL COUNT: 63 tools (was 62)

2. src/mcp/tools/viewTools.ts
   - Updated comment for openUserStoriesRoleRequirements() method
   - Added new openRequirementsFulfillment() method

3. src/commands/mcpViewCommands.ts
   - Fixed command `appdna.mcp.openUserStoriesRoleRequirements`:
     Changed from: appdna.showUserStoryRoleRequirements
     Changed to: appdna.showRoleRequirements (which opens "User Stories - Role Requirements")
   - Added new command `appdna.mcp.openRequirementsFulfillment` calling appdna.showRequirementsFulfillment

4. README.md
   - Updated tool count from 62 to 63 in all references

5. MCP_README.md
   - Updated User Story Views section from 6 to 7 tools
   - Clarified descriptions for both tools

6. docs/VIEWS-REFERENCE.md
   - Fixed incorrect command mapping for userStoryRoleRequirementsView.js
   - Added missing entry for requirementsFulfillmentView.js
   - Corrected tab information (both views have no tabs)

7. docs/MCP-VIEW-COMMANDS-REFERENCE.md
   - Updated description for open_user_stories_role_requirements_view
   - Added new entry for open_requirements_fulfillment_view

8. src/extension.ts
   - Added open_requirements_fulfillment_view to chat mode tools list
   - Chat mode now includes all 63 MCP tools

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- User Stories Role Requirements View: userStoryRoleRequirementsView.js
  * Title: "User Story - Role Requirements" (singular)
  * Shows which roles are required to access/complete each user story
  * RBAC-focused per-story view
  * Command: appdna.showUserStoryRoleRequirements → appdna.showRoleRequirements → appdna.roleRequirements
  
- Requirements Fulfillment View: requirementsFulfillmentView.js
  * Title: "Requirements Fulfillment" 
  * Shows fulfillment status across user stories, data objects, journeys
  * Tracks fulfilled vs unfulfilled role requirements
  * Cross-cutting view of entire model
  * Command: appdna.showRequirementsFulfillment

- Neither view has tabs (verified via grep search)
- Command flow: MCP tool → viewTools → mcpViewCommands → actual view command
- Three similar but distinct commands existed:
  * appdna.showUserStoryRoleRequirements (singular - wrong one)
  * appdna.showRoleRequirements (delegates to appdna.roleRequirements - correct one)
  * appdna.showRequirementsFulfillment (completely separate view)

VERIFICATION:
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Webpack bundling successful  
✅ Both MCP tools now call correct commands
✅ All documentation updated (5 files)
✅ Tool count updated from 62 to 63
✅ Clear separation of concerns between the two views

COMMAND: Review and fix user stories list view MCP tool tabs documentation
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED
===============================================================================

TASK:
Review the MCP tool for viewing user stories list view and the tab switching 
functionality. The user stories list view shows tabs: Stories, Details, Role Distribution.

ISSUES FOUND:
1. MCP tool description in server.ts had incorrect tab values:
   - Said "all" instead of "stories"
   - Said "roleAccess" instead of "analytics"
   - Missing "details" tab documentation

2. Tab descriptions were wrong:
   - Said "Role-Based Access (security requirements)" 
   - Should be "Role Distribution (analytics showing role distribution charts)"

CHANGES MADE:
File: src/mcp/server.ts (line ~964)
- Fixed tool description to list correct tabs: "Stories", "Details", "Role Distribution"
- Updated initialTab parameter values: "stories", "details", "analytics"
- Corrected tab descriptions to match actual implementation

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- User Stories view implemented in: src/webviews/userStoriesView.js
- Has 3 tabs with data-tab attributes: "stories", "details", "analytics"
- Tab switching handled by switchTab() function
- MCP command handler in: src/commands/mcpViewCommands.ts (had correct values)
- Documentation reference: docs/VIEWS-REFERENCE.md

     "Dev Bottlenecks", "Dev Distribution", "Dev Trends"
   - Reality: "Details", "Dev Queue", "Board", "Sprint", "Developers", "Forecast", "Cost", "Analysis"

2. Tab parameter values were incorrect:
   - Said: "devQueue", "all", "devMetrics", "devHistory", "devForecast", 
     "devBottlenecks", "devDistribution", "devTrends"
   - Should be: "details", "devQueue", "board", "sprint", "developers", "forecast", "cost", "analysis"

ACTUAL TAB STRUCTURE (from screenshot and code):
1. Details - 13-column table with filters and bulk operations
2. Dev Queue - Drag-and-drop priority queue
3. Board - Kanban board with 5 status columns
4. Sprint - Sprint planning and burndown chart
5. Developers - Developer management and capacity planning
6. Forecast - Gantt chart timeline with working hours
7. Cost - Monthly cost analysis by developer
8. Analysis - 6 KPIs and 5 D3.js charts

CHANGES MADE:
File: src/mcp/server.ts (line ~994)
- Updated tool description with correct 8 tabs and accurate descriptions
- Fixed initialTab parameter values to match actual onclick="switchTab(...)" values
- Updated inputSchema description with correct tab names

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- User Stories Dev view implemented in: src/webviews/userStoryDev/userStoryDevView.js

1. MCP tool description was too generic and didn't list tabs:
   - Said: "Shows the flow of user stories across different stages..."
   - No tab information provided
   - No mention of multiple tabs or analytics features

2. mcpViewCommands.ts had completely wrong tab information:
   - Said: 'journey' (visual journey map), 'list' (list view of journeys)
   - Reality: 7 completely different tabs for analytics and visualization

3. No initialTab parameter support (correctly documented as not supported)

ACTUAL TAB STRUCTURE (from code and screenshot):
1. User Stories - Story-page mappings with journey distances
2. Page Usage - Usage frequency table
3. Page Usage Treemap - Visual size representation by usage
4. Page Usage Distribution - Histogram of usage patterns
5. Page Usage vs Complexity - Scatter plot analysis (4 quadrants)
6. Journey Visualization - Treemap of journey complexity
7. Journey Distribution - Histogram of complexity categories

- Added detailed descriptions for each tab's functionality

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- User Stories Journey view implemented in: src/webviews/userStoriesJourneyView.js
- HTML structure in: src/commands/userStoriesJourneyCommands.ts (line ~2878)
- Tab switching uses data-tab attribute pattern
- Tab content divs use id="{tabName}-tab" pattern
- 7 tabs with values: "user-stories", "page-usage", "page-usage-treemap", 
  "page-usage-distribution", "page-usage-vs-complexity", "journey-visualization", "journey-distribution"
- NO initialTab parameter support (view always opens on first tab)

VERIFICATION:
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
✅ Tab names match actual HTML data-tab attributes
✅ All 7 tabs documented with accurate descriptions
✅ Correctly noted that initialTab is not supported

===============================================================================

===============================================================================

Command: Add MCP tools to open Add Data Object and Add Report wizards
Status: ✅ COMPLETED

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Similar to the MCP tool that shows the add data object wizard, we need a MCP 
tool to show the add report wizard.

SOLUTION:
Added two new MCP tools (discovered that add data object wizard tool was also 
missing):
1. open_add_data_object_wizard - Opens Add Data Object Wizard
2. open_add_report_wizard - Opens Add Report Wizard

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- MCP tools registered in src/mcp/server.ts (stdio transport)
- Tools also registered in src/mcp/mcpProvider.ts (VS Code API)
- ViewTools class extended with wizard methods
- MCP view commands added in mcpViewCommands.ts
- Commands delegate to existing appdna.addObject and appdna.addReport
- HTTP bridge (port 3002) used for extension communication

CHANGES:
- Total MCP tools: 50 → 52
- VS Code API tools: 19 → 21
- Files modified: 5 (viewTools.ts, mcpViewCommands.ts, server.ts, 
  mcpProvider.ts, MCP_README.md)
- New files: 2 (wizard-mcp-tools.test.ts, 
  WIZARD_MCP_TOOLS_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- Lines added: 327

TESTING:
✅ Build successful
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ Unit tests pass
✅ CodeQL security scan: 0 issues

USAGE:
GitHub Copilot users can now use natural language:
- "Open the add data object wizard"
- "Open the add report wizard"
- "Show me the wizard to create a new data object"
- "Show me the wizard to create a new report"

KEY LEARNINGS:
1. MCP tools need registration in both server.ts and mcpProvider.ts
2. ViewTools methods use HTTP bridge for command execution
3. MCP commands in mcpViewCommands.ts are hidden from command palette
4. Tool count updates required in both server and provider
5. Documentation updates critical for discoverability

DATE: October 19, 2025
COMMAND: Add MCP tool to open report details view
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

TASK:
Similar to the MCP tool that opens the data object details view, implement an MCP tool that opens a report details view. The tool was already registered in server.ts but the implementation threw an error.

CHANGES MADE:
Files Modified:
1. src/commands/mcpViewCommands.ts
   - Added appdna.mcp.openReportDetails command (lines 130-157)
   - Command takes reportName (string) and optional initialTab parameter
   - Validates model is loaded and report exists
   - Creates mock tree item with contextValue 'reportItem'
   - Calls appdna.showReportDetails command
   - Added 'report-details' to generic view opener map (line 165)

2. src/mcp/tools/viewTools.ts
   - Updated openReportDetails() method (lines 287-289)
   - Changed from throwing error to calling appdna.mcp.openReportDetails command
   - Passes reportName and optional initialTab parameters

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Report Details view: src/webviews/reports/reportDetailsView.js
- Existing command: appdna.showReportDetails
- Command takes tree item with contextValue 'reportItem'
- ModelService.getAllReports() returns array of reports
- Report has 4 tabs: settings, inputControls, buttons, outputVars
- Pattern follows data object details implementation exactly

TAB VALUES:
- "settings" - Report configuration
- "inputControls" - Parameters and filters
- "buttons" - Actions and downloads
- "outputVars" - Data outputs

VERIFICATION:
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Webpack bundling successful
✅ MCP server compilation successful
✅ ESLint passed (0 errors in changed files)

NO TESTS:
No unit tests exist for MCP view commands. Manual testing would be required but is outside the scope of this task.

- Creates mock tree item to pass to existing appdna.showFormDetails command
- Form details view shows: Settings, Input Controls, Buttons, Output Variables tabs
- Verified implementation with custom test script - all tests passed
- Updated MCP-VIEW-COMMANDS-REFERENCE.md documentation

--- October 19, 2025 ---
[COMPLETED] Review MCP commands - Comprehensive review of all 71 MCP tools across server.ts and tool implementations
[COMPLETED] Fix duplicate openAddDataObjectWizard implementations - Removed 2 duplicate methods from viewTools.ts
[COMPLETED] Add missing openAddReportWizard method - Added to viewTools.ts to match server.ts registration
[COMPLETED] Sync README tool count (71 vs 65) - Updated MCP_README.md with accurate breakdown of all 71 tools, reorganized categories

Architecture Notes:
- MCP server has 71 registered tools (not 65 as previously documented)
- Tools organized into: User Story (5), Role (4), Lookup (4), Data Object (10), Wizards (3), Views (44), Utility (1)
- Fixed duplicate registrations and missing method implementations
- Documentation now accurately reflects implementation

[COMPLETED] Update AppDNA ChatMode tool list - Updated extension.ts createAppDNAChatMode() function with accurate 71 tool count, added missing open_add_form_wizard, reorganized all tool categories with correct counts

[COMPLETED] Fix MCP duplicate tool registration - Removed duplicate open_add_data_object_wizard registration from server.ts, updated all documentation from 71 to 70 tools

Error Fixed:
- Tool 'open_add_data_object_wizard' was registered twice (lines 1256 and 2275)
- Removed duplicate at line 2275 in WIZARD VIEWS section
- MCP server now starts successfully with 70 unique tools


[COMPLETED] Add smart page details MCP tool - Created open_page_details tool that intelligently determines if a page is a form or report and opens the appropriate view

Implementation:

Benefit:
- Users don't need to know if a page is a form or report
- Single tool for all page details access
- Better user experience with natural language queries


[COMPLETED] Consolidate smart page router into openPageDetails() method

Changes:
- Moved smart router implementation from openPageDetailsView() into openPageDetails()
- Removed duplicate openPageDetailsView() method from viewTools.ts
- Updated openPageDetails() from 'not implemented' to fully functional smart router
- Both MCP tools (open_page_details and open_page_details_view) now use same method
- Updated server.ts to call openPageDetails() instead of openPageDetailsView()
- Updated tool description to clarify it's a smart router for forms/reports

Benefit:
- Eliminated code duplication
- Single implementation point for smart routing logic
- Original openPageDetails() method now functional instead of throwing error
- Cleaner architecture with no redundant methods


[COMPLETED] Remove open_page_details tool, keep open_page_details_view

Changes:
- Removed 'open_page_details' tool registration from server.ts
- Kept 'open_page_details_view' tool (the one we want)
- Updated extension.ts ChatMode to remove open_page_details from tools list
- Updated tool description to clarify open_page_details_view is the smart router
- Updated tool count from 71 back to 70 tools across all documentation
- Updated MCP_README.md tool count (71  70)

Reason:
- Eliminate confusion between two similar tool names
- Single smart router tool with clear name (open_page_details_view)
- Cleaner API with one canonical way to open page details

Final State:
- openPageDetails() method in viewTools.ts contains smart router logic
- open_page_details_view MCP tool uses openPageDetails() method
- Tool count: 70 tools total


[COMPLETED] Add save_model MCP tool - Execute save command from tree view

Changes:
- Created new file: src/mcp/tools/modelTools.ts
- Added ModelTools class with save_model() method
- Registered save_model tool in server.ts (new Model Operations section)
- Updated compile-mcp and watch-mcp scripts to include modelTools.ts
- Updated tool count from 70 to 71 across all documentation
- Added 'Model Operations (1 Tool)' section to ChatMode and MCP_README.md

Implementation:
- save_model() calls 'appdna.saveFile' command via HTTP bridge (port 3002)
- Same operation as clicking the save icon button in the tree view
- 10 second timeout for save operations
- Returns success confirmation or error message

Usage:
- GitHub Copilot can now save model changes with: 'save the model'
- Tool persists all changes to app-dna.json file
- Confirms successful save or reports errors

Final State:
- Tool count: 71 tools total
- New category: Model Operations (1 tool)
- All compilation successful
