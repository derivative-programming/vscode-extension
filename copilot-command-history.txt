USER REQUEST: "Review the data object list view and its 'download csv' icon button. Review the model change request list view. We want to add a similar 'download csv' button there."
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made**:
1. Modified `changeRequestsListView.ts`:
   - Added export button to HTML template in action-controls section
   - Added 'exportToCSV' message handler that calls `saveChangeRequestsToCSV()`
   - Added 'saveCsvToWorkspace' message handler to save and open CSV file
   - Added `saveChangeRequestsToCSV()` function that generates CSV with headers: Code, Description, Property Name, Old Value, New Value, Status, Rejection Reason

2. Modified `changeRequestsListView.js`:
   - Added event listener for export button click
   - Added `exportToCSV()` function that sends 'exportToCSV' message to extension
   - Added 'csvExportReady' message handler that forwards to 'saveCsvToWorkspace'

**Technical Details**:
- CSV export flow: webview 'exportToCSV' → extension generates CSV → 'csvExportReady' → webview sends 'saveCsvToWorkspace' → extension saves and opens file
- Uses same pattern as dataObjectListView.js for consistency
- CSV filename includes request code and timestamp: `change-requests-{requestCode}-{timestamp}.csv`
- All CSV values are properly quoted and escaped for proper parsing
- File opens automatically in VS Code after successful save
- Export button styled consistent with refresh/validate buttons

**Architecture Notes**:
- Maintains consistent UX across all CSV export functionality
- Follows existing message-passing patterns between webview and extension
- All change request fields included in export for comprehensive data access
 
﻿2024-12-31 XX:XX:XX - ADD DATA OBJECT WIZARD - SETTINGS TAB SELECTION FIX (UPDATED)
USER REQUEST: "Add Data Object Wizard was opening the object details view without properly selecting the settings tab"
FOLLOW-UP: "context should be the third require param to showobjectdetails. initialTab should be an optional fourth param with default value 'settings'"
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Changes Made**:
1. Updated showObjectDetails function signature in objects/objectDetailsView.js
   - Changed from: (item, modelService, initialTab = 'settings')
   - Changed to: (item, modelService, context, initialTab = 'settings')
   - Now matches pattern of other detail views (showReportDetails, showFormDetails, etc.)

2. Updated wrapper function in objectDetailsView.js
   - Added context parameter to maintain consistency

3. Updated all calls to showObjectDetails across codebase:
   - addObjectWizardView.js line 164: Added context parameter, kept 'settings' as initialTab
   - registerCommands.ts line 342: Added context parameter, kept 'settings' as initialTab  
   - registerCommands.ts line 619: Added context parameter, preserved existing initialTab variable
   - reportDetailsView.js line 393: Added context parameter (currentContext), set 'settings' as initialTab
   - hierarchyView.js line 75: Added 'settings' as initialTab (context was already correct)

**Architecture Notes**:
- showObjectDetails function signature: (item, modelService, context, initialTab = 'settings')
- Pattern now consistent with other detail views requiring context parameter
- Tab restoration uses setTimeout with postMessage command 'restoreTab'
- Wizard now properly opens object details with settings tab selected
- All calls maintain consistency: context as 3rd param, initialTab as optional 4th param
