Command: review the object details view
Date: June 28, 2025
Purpose: User requested a review of the object details view implementation

Context: Examining the object details view structure, components, and templates to understand the current architecture and implementation.

Command: review the settings, properties, and lookup items tabs
Date: June 28, 2025
Purpose: User requested a detailed review of the three tabs in the object details view

Context: Examining the Settings tab, Properties tab, and Lookup Items tab implementation, including their templates, functionality, and user experience.

Command: fix lookup items tab to match properties tab structure
Date: June 28, 2025
Purpose: User reported that lookup items tab doesn't look and work similar to properties tab

Context: Need to examine and update lookup items template to match the structure, styling, and functionality of the properties table template.

Command: review the data object details view. it has 3 tabs. the lookup items tab is based on the properties tab. fix the lookup items tab
Date: June 28, 2025
Purpose: User requested to fix the lookup items tab to match the properties tab structure and functionality

Context: The lookup items tab in the data object details view needs to be updated to match the structure, styling, and functionality of the properties tab. The main template shows that the lookup items list is not properly populated (commented as "will be populated by JavaScript").

COMPLETED: Fixed multiple issues with the lookup items tab to match properties tab structure:
1. **List Population**: Updated mainTemplate.js to populate lookup items list directly in template like properties tab does, replacing "<!-- Options will be populated by JavaScript -->" with actual lookup item mapping
2. **Data Initialization**: Added lookupItem array initialization in objectDetailsView.js to ensure empty array is available when object doesn't have lookup items
3. **Copy Functionality**: Added copy button functionality for lookup items in domInitialization.js, matching the copy functionality available in properties tab
4. **JavaScript Optimization**: Updated lookupItemManagement.js to avoid overriding template-populated list unless it's empty, preventing conflicts between template and JavaScript population
5. **Consistency**: Ensured lookup items tab now follows same patterns as properties tab for list display, selection handling, and user interactions

Command: it does not seem like the table view has the correct values in the fields
Date: June 28, 2025
Purpose: User reported that the table view doesn't show correct values in the lookup items tab

Context: While the list view was fixed, the table view for lookup items was not displaying the correct field values due to schema mismatch and hardcoded column definitions.

COMPLETED: Fixed lookup items table view value display issues:
1. **Schema Consistency**: Updated detailsViewGenerator.js to pass lookupItemsSchema to clientScriptTemplate
2. **Dynamic Columns**: Modified clientScriptTemplate.js to generate lookup columns from schema and pass to JavaScript
3. **Table Population**: Fixed updateLookupItemsTable function in lookupItemManagement.js to use schema-based columns instead of hardcoded array
4. **Field Types**: Enhanced table generation to properly handle enum fields with dropdowns vs text inputs based on schema
5. **Data Refresh**: Fixed refreshAll function in objectDetailsView.js to properly initialize lookupItem array during refresh
6. **Value Mapping**: Ensured correct value mapping between object data and table cells, including proper selected states for enum dropdowns

2025-06-28: Update lookup item modal to use generateHeaderText-like logic to auto-populate displayName and description from name value.
2024-12-28 - Review and verify lookup item modal auto-population logic for displayName/description using PascalCase-to-spaced conversion (generateHeaderText-like logic)
- Reviewed the existing lookupItemModalFunctionality.js implementation
- Confirmed that generateDisplayText() and generateDescriptionText() functions already implement the correct PascalCase-to-spaced conversion logic
- Verified that the logic matches the generateHeaderText() function from addColumnModalFunctionality.js
- Both use the same regex patterns: ([a-z])([A-Z]) and ([A-Z])([A-Z][a-z])
- Auto-population is already working correctly for cases like "AppDNA" → "App DNA", "DNAApp" → "DNA App"
- The modal functionality is already complete and matches the requirements
