August 5, 2025 - Role Requirements View Validate Button Background Fix - COMPLETED

COMPLETED: Fixed Role Requirements View Validate Button Background Color
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "lets fix the 'validate all requirements button on the user story role requirements view too"
- Root Cause: Validate button had background color set both in CSS and JavaScript, causing visual inconsistency
- Changes Made:
  * Updated roleRequirementsView.js JavaScript styling to use `background: none` pattern
  * Added `.icon-button` CSS class to roleRequirementsCommands.ts for consistency
  * Changed validateButton HTML class from `validate-button` to `icon-button`
  * Updated hover effects to use `var(--vscode-toolbar-hoverBackground)` pattern
  * Made button styling consistent with export button fix from QA view
- Architecture: All icon buttons now use consistent `background: none` styling pattern across views

August 5, 2025 - User Stories QA View Export Button Background Fix - COMPLETED

COMPLETED: Removed Background Color from User Stories QA Export Button
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY  
- Request: "it seems like the icon button has a background color. remove it"
- Root Cause: QA view was missing the `.icon-button` CSS class definition with `background: none`
- Changes Made:
  * Added `.icon-button` CSS class to userStoriesQACommands.ts matching the working user stories view pattern
  * Set `background: none` and proper hover/focus states for icon buttons
  * Export button now displays as a clean icon without background color
- Architecture: Icon buttons now use consistent styling across both views (user stories and QA)

August 5, 2025 - User Stories QA View Export Button Fix - COMPLETED

COMPLETED: Fixed User Stories QA View Export Button Not Working
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "review the user stories qa view. review the export button. It does not work. We are doing something similar on the user stories view that works correctly"
- Root Cause: QA view was missing the `saveCsvToWorkspace` command handler in the extension
- Changes Made:
  * Added `saveCsvToWorkspace` command handler to userStoriesQACommands.ts following the same pattern as userStoriesView
  * Updated userStoriesQAView.js to send `saveCsvToWorkspace` command instead of attempting direct download
  * Removed unused `downloadCSV` function from QA view
  * Now follows the same workflow as working user stories view: webview → extension generates CSV → webview saves to workspace
- Architecture: Both views now use consistent CSV export pattern: command → generate → save to workspace

August 4, 2025 - User Stories QA View Implementation - COMPLETED

COMPLETED: Created User Stories QA View with QA Tracking
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY  
- Request: "I need a new view for 'User Stories - QA'. It should use a similar design as the User storiess role requirements view, but i have not determined the filters or columns yet. also add a QA treeview item under the 'Stories' item"
- Updated Requirements: Specific columns, filters, and functionality based on todo.md specifications
- Implementation: Complete QA tracking system following Role Requirements view design patterns

COMPLETED: Fixed Bulk Update and Date Display Issues
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "when i apply status in bulk, the table row is not updated" & "when i set status to Success or failure, the date is not displayed in the date verified column"
- Architecture Pattern: Changed from async message-response pattern to immediate local update pattern (following roleRequirementsView.js)
- Implementation: Local data updates with immediate table re-rendering, proper date handling for success/failure statuses
- Features Fixed:
  * Bulk status updates now update table rows immediately
  * Individual status changes update date verified field immediately when status = success/failure
  * Removed bulkUpdateCompleted message pattern in favor of immediate UI updates
  * Date verification automatically set to current date when status changes to success or failure

COMPLETED: Row Click to Toggle Checkbox
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "on click of the row, change the value of the row checkbox."
- Architecture Pattern: Event delegation with click filtering to avoid conflicts with interactive elements
- Implementation: Added handleRowClick function with intelligent click filtering and checkbox toggling
- Features Added:
  * Click anywhere on table row to toggle checkbox selection
  * Smart filtering prevents conflicts with dropdowns, textareas, and other interactive elements  
  * Visual feedback with cursor pointer and existing hover styles
  * Maintains existing checkbox functionality while adding row-level interaction
  * Updates selection state and apply button state properly

COMPLETED: Fixed Status Dropdown Value Persistence Issue  
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "the status dropdown just shows pending" & "if i change it, it goes back to pending. same for bulk update"
- Root Cause Analysis: Multiple issues causing dropdown value problems
  * Setting dropdown value BEFORE adding option elements (value assignment had no effect)
  * handleQAStatusChange() was calling renderTable() which destroyed all dropdown states
  * Table re-rendering was causing dropdown selections to revert to stored values
- Implementation: Fixed value assignment order and eliminated unnecessary table re-rendering
- Architecture Pattern: Selective DOM updates instead of full table re-rendering for better UX
- Features Fixed:
  * Moved qaStatusSelect.value assignment AFTER options are added to DOM
  * Eliminated renderTable() call in handleQAStatusChange to preserve dropdown states  
  * Added data-story-id attribute to rows for efficient element targeting
  * Implemented selective date cell updates without full table re-render
  * Status dropdowns now properly show and maintain selected values
  * Individual and bulk status changes persist correctly

COMPLETED: Fixed Compilation Error in UserStoriesQA Commands
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "Activating extension 'derivative-programming.appdna' failed: Module parse failed: Unterminated string constant (64:0)"
- Root Cause: Previous edit to fix codicons import accidentally corrupted the import statements and created syntax errors
- Issues Found:
  * Broken import statement: `import { ModelService } from` was corrupted with HTML template code
  * Stray HTML template fragment in middle of imports section
  * String literal corruption causing parsing failures
- Implementation: Clean surgical fixes to restore proper file structure
- Features Fixed:
  * Restored proper import statement: `import { ModelService } from '../services/modelService';`
  * Removed corrupted HTML template fragments from imports section
  * Verified codiconsUri variable is properly defined before HTML template
  * Ensured HTML template string is properly closed with backtick
  * Extension now compiles and activates without errors

COMPLETED: Fixed Refresh Button Icon Display
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "the referesh icon is still not displayed. it should be displayed as we do on the role requirements page" & "review how it imports codicons too"
- Root Cause Analysis: 
  * QA view was importing codicons from 'media/codicon.css' which was just a placeholder file
  * Role requirements view imports from 'node_modules/@vscode/codicons/dist/codicon.css' (the real codicons)
  * Role requirements pattern: Empty HTML button + JavaScript sets innerHTML with icon
  * QA view was trying to use pre-defined HTML icon which couldn't render due to missing CSS
- Implementation: Complete rewrite to match role requirements pattern exactly
- Architecture Pattern: JavaScript-driven icon setup with proper codicons import path
- Features Fixed:
  * Changed codicons import from placeholder 'media/codicon.css' to proper 'node_modules/@vscode/codicons/dist/codicon.css'
  * Updated HTML to empty button like role requirements view
  * Added JavaScript icon setup matching role requirements exactly: innerHTML with span.codicon.codicon-refresh
  * Applied all styling properties from role requirements pattern (background, border, padding, hover effects)
  * Refresh button now properly displays codicon-refresh icon with consistent styling
- Features Added:
  * User Stories QA view with table showing only processed user stories (isStoryProcessed="true")
  * Checkbox column with select all/individual selection functionality
  * Story Number, Story Text, Status (dropdown), Notes (textarea), Date Verified, QA By columns

  * Sortable columns matching page list design patterns
  * Data stored in separate app-dna-user-story-qa.json file
  * QA tree view item added under Stories in USER STORIES section
  * Bulk Update Selected button for future bulk operations
- Files Created:
  * src/commands/userStoriesQACommands.ts (command registration and data management)
  * src/webviews/userStoriesQAView.js (JavaScript webview with table rendering, filtering, and checkbox selection)
  * src/webviews/userStoriesQAView.ts (TypeScript wrapper)
- Files Modified:
  * src/commands/registerCommands.ts (added command registration and panel management)
  * package.json (added appdna.userStoriesQA command with checklist icon)
  * src/providers/jsonTreeDataProvider.ts (added QA item under Stories)
- Data Structure: Separate JSON file with qaData array containing storyId, qaStatus, qaNotes, dateVerified, qaBy fields
- Architecture: Follows exact same patterns as roleRequirementsView for consistency across extension
- Specifications Met:
  ✅ Only shows stories where isStoryProcessed="true"

- Implementation: Complete validation system with visual feedback and summary reporting
- Features Added:
  * Validate button with check icon positioned left of refresh button
  * validateAllRequirements() function that checks all rows for business rule violations
  * Validation summary panel showing success/error states with detailed breakdown
  * Auto-validation after bulk apply operations with 100ms delay for table rendering
  * Error grouping by validation message type for better readability
  * Auto-hide success messages after 5 seconds

  * src/webviews/roleRequirementsView.js - Added validation functions, button setup, auto-validation after bulk apply
- User Experience: Users can now validate all requirements at once and see comprehensive error reports
- Technical Notes: Validation runs client-side using existing validateRoleAccess() function, groups errors by message type, displays up to 10 items per error type

COMPLETED: Fix Role Requirements Apply Button View Update Issue
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Problem: Apply button in Role Requirements view was not updating the table display after bulk access changes
- Root Cause: Missing renderTable() call after bulk changes were applied to local data
- Architecture: Webview message passing pattern with local data updates and separate table rendering
- Files Modified:
  * src/webviews/roleRequirementsView.js - Added renderTable() call in apply button click handler
- Solution: Added renderTable() after bulk access changes to refresh the table display immediately
- Impact: Users can now see updated access levels in the table immediately after clicking "Apply to Selected"
- Technical Notes: handleAccessChange() updates local data arrays but doesn't trigger UI refresh - requires manual renderTable() call

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Redesigned Role Requirements View to Match Page List Design
- User request: "review the user story role requirements view. we are going to redesign it. it will have the same design as the page list view" and "The column is not 'story text', the column is 'Data Object' use names of all data objects. textbox filter" and "values for access will be stored in a separate app-dna-user-story-role-requirements.json file"
- Final specification: Table with columns Role | Data Object | Action | Access, showing all combinations
- Solution: Complete redesign following page list view patterns
  - Created roleRequirementsCommands.ts with full command registration and data loading
  - Created roleRequirementsView.js with table rendering, filtering, and inline editing

  - Sortable columns, refresh functionality, record count display, spinner loading
- BUG FIX: Fixed ModelService API usage error
  - Issue: "TypeError: modelService.getModel is not a function"
  - Root cause: Incorrect API call - method is getCurrentModel(), not getModel()
  - Solution: Updated to use proper ModelService methods (getAllObjects, getAllForms, getAllReports)
- Files: 
  - src/commands/roleRequirementsCommands.ts (complete implementation)
  - src/webviews/roleRequirementsView.js (JavaScript webview matching page list patterns)

- User request: "add a 'Role Requirements' item above 'Stories'"
- Solution: Added new 'Role Requirements' item as first child of USER STORIES section, positioned above existing Stories item
- New item uses contextValue 'userStoriesRoleRequirements' and command 'appdna.showRoleRequirements'
- File modified: src/providers/jsonTreeDataProvider.ts
- Architecture: Extended USER STORIES section with role requirements management capability

2025-08-02: for a report grid view filter of datetime i see a dropdown
2025-08-02: check the display of report grid filters too
2025-08-02: review the page preview details view. on a form preview make sure a control of data type 'datetime' shows a date picker and time picker. on date type 'date' its just a date picker
2025-08-02: on sql server data type properties we show a dropdown on many views. The items in this dropdown should be in alpha order
2025-08-02: i see data object details view props tab prop setting Sql Server DB Data Type: dropdown as unsorted
2025-08-02: its the data object details view properties tab list view
2025-08-02: COMPLETED: Fixed all dropdown sorting across entire extension
- User request expanded from SQL Server data type dropdowns to "all tabs of the form details view as well" and "all dropdowns, not just sql server data type"

- Files modified: 

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Created new 'Page List' view feature
- User requested table view similar to model feature catalog showing all pages (forms and reports)
- Solution: Created complete page list implementation with sorting, filtering, and action buttons
- Files created:
  - src/commands/pageListCommands.ts (command registration and data loading from ModelService)
  - src/webviews/pageListView.js (JavaScript webview with table, sorting, filtering)
- Files modified:
  - package.json (added appdna.pageList command and table icon menu item for PAGES tree item)
- Architecture: Uses ModelService.getAllObjects() to extract forms/reports where isPage='true', provides preview and details buttons
- Tree integration: PAGES item already had 'showPageList' context value, table icon now appears on PAGES tree item 
  * Report templates (14+ files): All columnTableTemplate, parameterTableTemplate, etc.
  * Object templates (7+ files): All propertiesTableTemplate, settingsTemplate, lookupItemsTemplate, etc.
  * Form templates (9+ files): All settingsTabTemplate, paramsTableTemplate, modalTemplates, buttonsTableTemplate, etc.
  * Script files: parameterManagementFunctions.js
- Pattern used: schema.enum.slice().sort().map() instead of schema.enum.map()
- Total enum patterns fixed: 25+ locations across webview templates
- Verification: Final grep search confirmed no remaining unsorted enum patterns

2025-08-02: review the page preview view report grid preview.  There is a scrollbar at the bottom under the paging and export controls. it shoudl be between the table and paging controls
COMPLETED: Fixed report grid scrollbar positioning in page preview
- Issue: Horizontal scrollbar appeared below both pagination controls and export buttons
- Solution: Restructured HTML to separate scrollable table area from pagination/export controls
- Added report-grid-wrapper as outer container with borders
- report-grid-container now contains only the scrollable table with overflow-x: auto
- Pagination controls positioned after scrollable area, export buttons after pagination
- Updated CSS to remove redundant borders since wrapper handles borders
- Result: Horizontal scrollbar now correctly positioned between table and pagination controls
- File modified: src/webviews/pagepreview/components/htmlGenerator.js

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Page List View UI improvements
- User requested three changes to page list view:
  1. ✅ Refresh icon button already implemented correctly (matches model feature catalog pattern)
  2. ✅ Removed 'Apply Filters' button - filters now work immediately on change (real-time filtering with 300ms debounce)
  3. ✅ Removed 'List' report type from dropdown and data processing logic (does not exist)
- Solution: Modified HTML template to remove apply filters button while keeping clear filters button, updated report type dropdown options, removed 'list' visualization type mapping
- CORRECTION: Added back 'Clear All' button after user pointed out it was needed to reset filter fields
- Files modified: 
  - src/commands/pageListCommands.ts (HTML template and data processing logic)
- Architecture: Filters already had real-time functionality with debounced input events, just removed manual apply button
- Result: Cleaner UI with immediate filter feedback, clear all functionality preserved, accurate report type options
