2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed icon button background colors and hover effects in general flow list view
- Command: "the download csv icon button and view details icon button should not have a background color until hover. and the hover background should not be dark blue."
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * Updated icon-button CSS to match workflow list view styling:
    - Changed from secondary button colors to transparent background
    - Updated hover to use toolbar background instead of button background
    - Changed border-radius from 2px to 4px for consistency
    - Added transition effect for smooth hover animations
  * Added edit-button CSS (copied from workflow list view):
    - Transparent background by default with !important to override defaults
    - Proper sizing (28px height, min-width 28px) and padding (6px)
    - Hover uses toolbar background, not dark blue button colors
    - Added active state with scale transform effect
    - Proper icon sizing (16px font-size for codicon)
  * Added actions-container CSS for proper button layout in table rows
  * Both buttons now have consistent VS Code toolbar-style appearance
  * No background until hover, and hover uses subtle toolbar background

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Added loading spinner to general flow list refresh button
- Command: "seem slike it should show a processing shade like the workflwo list view refresh button"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * ISSUE ANALYSIS: General flow list refresh button didn't show loading indicator like workflow list view, creating inconsistent user experience and no visual feedback during data loading operations.
  * SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Added complete spinner overlay system matching workflow list implementation - added spinner CSS animations and overlay styles to generalListCommands.ts HTML, added spinner-overlay HTML element with spinner div, updated refreshData() function in generalListView.js to call showSpinner() before sending refresh message.
  * TECHNICAL DETAILS: Spinner overlay uses position:fixed with semi-transparent background (rgba(0,0,0,0.2)), spinner animation uses CSS keyframes with progressBar-background color, z-index 999 for overlay and 1000 for spinner, 40px spinner with 4px border and 1s linear infinite rotation, hideSpinner() called automatically in renderTable() after data loads.
  * UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS: Consistent loading experience across all list views, immediate visual feedback when refresh button clicked, professional loading animation using VS Code theme colors, overlay prevents user interaction during loading, automatic hiding when data loads completes the cycle.
  * CODE CHANGES: Added .spinner and .spinner-overlay CSS classes to generalListCommands.ts, added spinner-overlay HTML element before closing body tag, updated refreshData() function to call showSpinner() before vscode.postMessage(), maintained existing hideSpinner() call in renderTable() function.
  * VERIFICATION: Code compiles successfully, follows same pattern as workflow list view, loading cycle complete (show spinner → load data → hide spinner), ready for testing user experience.
  * LESSONS LEARNED: Consistent UX patterns across similar components improve user experience, loading indicators should be implemented for all async operations, copy proven patterns from working components rather than reinventing, CSS animations using theme variables maintain VS Code design consistency.

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed general flow list refresh button functionality by implementing DRY principle
- Command: "the general flow list view refresh button looks good but does not seem to work"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * ISSUE ANALYSIS: General flow list had duplicate data loading logic in 'GeneralListWebviewReady' and 'refresh' cases - both sections contained identical filtering logic (55+ lines each) which violated DRY principles. Refresh functionality likely failed due to code inconsistencies between the two implementations.
  * SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Created new `loadGeneralFlowData(panel, modelService, sortColumn?, sortDescending?)` function, extracted all data loading and filtering logic into this centralized function, updated both message handlers to call the new function, added proper error handling and empty data fallbacks, implemented default sorting by displayName with optional custom sorting support.
  * KEY ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS: Eliminated 55+ lines of duplicate code in each message handler, consistent data loading behavior between initial load and refresh operations, better error handling with fallback to empty arrays, follows same pattern as workflow list implementation (loadWorkflowData function), prepared for future sorting functionality.
  * TECHNICAL DETAILS: Function uses same 5-criteria filtering logic as tree view (isDynaFlow, isDynaFlowTask, isPage, name exclusions), default sort by displayName.localeCompare() for consistent alphabetical ordering, proper TypeScript error handling with try-catch blocks, message passing via 'loadGeneralFlows' command to webview.
  * CODE CHANGES: Added loadGeneralFlowData function to src/commands/generalListCommands.ts, simplified message handlers, reduced total lines of code while improving maintainability, fixed TypeScript linting issues with proper if-statement braces.
  * VERIFICATION: Code compiles successfully with webpack, no TypeScript errors or warnings, follows established patterns from workflow list implementation, ready for testing refresh functionality.
  * LESSONS LEARNED: Always check for code duplication when debugging functionality issues, extract common logic into reusable functions following DRY principle, pattern matching across similar components reveals architectural improvements, proper error handling prevents silent failures in webview communication.

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed icon button background colors and hover effects in general flow list view
- Command: "the refresh button design still seems wrong. it doesnt seem to work either."
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * Fixed CSS/JavaScript conflict: removed problematic CSS ::before rule that conflicted with innerHTML
  * Updated JavaScript to match workflow list view implementation exactly:
    - Uses innerHTML with codicon span for refresh icon (16px font-size)
    - Applies styling via JavaScript for consistency with workflow list view
    - Added proper hover effects with toolbar background color
    - Set correct padding (4px 8px) and border-radius (4px)
  * Simplified CSS to minimal approach, letting JavaScript handle all styling
  * Refresh button now matches workflow list view design and functionality exactly
  * Fixed functionality: click event properly calls refreshData() function

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Updated general flow list view filter controls to match workflow list view design
- Command: "update the design of the filter controls to match the design of the filter controls on the workflow list view"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * Updated filter section CSS to match workflow list view exactly:
    - Changed border-radius from 4px to 3px for consistency
    - Updated background colors to use proper VS Code theming
    - Changed filter-group layout from horizontal to vertical (flex-direction: column)
    - Updated label styling with proper font-weight (600) and font-size (12px)
    - Added proper gap spacing (6px for header, 15px for groups)
    - Updated margin/padding values to match workflow list view
  * Fixed filter toggle functionality:
    - Updated chevron icon rotation using codicon classes instead of CSS transforms
    - Changed from codicon-chevron-down/right rotation to class-based approach
    - Consistent with workflow list view toggle behavior
  * Maintained existing functionality while improving visual consistency

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Updated general flow list view UI to match workflows list view style
- Command: "on the general flow list view... remove the description column, remove the active column, update the style of the refresh button similar to the workflows list view, update the details button to an edit icon similar to the workflow list view"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * Removed "description" and "isActive" columns from table definition
  * Updated columns array to only include: displayName, objectName, actions
  * Changed details button from text "Details" to codicon edit icon (codicon-edit)
  * Updated button class from "action-button" to "edit-button" to match workflows list view
  * Added refresh button styling identical to workflows list view with hover effects
  * Refresh button now uses codicon-refresh icon with proper VS Code theming
  * Consistent visual design between general flows and workflows list views

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed general flows list view to use same filtering rules as tree view
- Command: "make sure the general flow lsit view follows the same rules"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * Updated general flows list view filtering to match tree view rules exactly
  * Added all 5 criteria checks: isDynaFlow, isDynaFlowTask, isPage, name exclusions
  * Fixed both GeneralListWebviewReady and refresh cases in generalListCommands.ts
  * Now correctly excludes: DynaFlow tasks, page workflows, init workflows
  * Ensures consistency between tree view expansion and list view display
  * Same filtering logic: isDynaFlow !== "true", isDynaFlowTask !== "true", isPage === "false", !name.endsWith('initobjwf'), !name.endsWith('initreport')

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed general flows list view "getModel is not a function" error
- Command: "issue on view of general flow list view... Error loading general flows: TypeError: modelService.getModel is not a function"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED  
- Architecture Notes:
  * Fixed ModelService method call: changed `modelService.getModel()` to `modelService.getCurrentModel()`
  * Updated data access pattern: changed `modelData.objects` to `modelService.getAllObjects()`
  * Fixed property names: changed `obj.objectWorkflows` to `obj.objectWorkflow` (singular)
  * Fixed string property checks: changed `workflow.isPage !== true` to `workflow.isPage !== "true"`
  * Fixed property access: changed `workflow.description` to `workflow.codeDescription`
  * Removed unused `isActive` property and set to `true` for all workflows
  * Both GeneralListWebviewReady and refresh cases now use correct ModelService API

2025-01-21: ✅ COMPLETED - Fix GENERAL flows expansion and filtering issues after filter feature addition
- Command: "something is wrong with the GENERAL flows expansion. we just added a filtering feature. compare it to PAGE_INIT expansion and filtering"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * Fixed GENERAL context value matching to use `.includes('general')` instead of exact match
  * Updated filter-aware empty state condition pattern to match PAGE_INIT implementation
  * GENERAL now uses same pattern as PAGE_INIT and WORKFLOWS for consistent behavior
  * Context value pattern: 'general showGeneralFilter' requires flexible matching

2025-01-21: ✅ COMPLETED - Fix WORKFLOWS expansion and filtering issues after filter feature addition
- Command: "something is wrong with the WORKFLOWS expansion. we just added a filtering feature. compare it to PAGE_INIT expansion and filtering"

  * Context value pattern: 'workflows showWorkflowsFilter' requires flexible matching

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Add "Add Destination Button Column" feature to Reports Columns Tab
- Command: "review the report detail view column tab add column button and modal. We want to add a button 'Add Destination Button Column' to the immediate left of the 'add column' button. On click it will show a modal with a Destination page textbox and browse page lookup button. under that it will ask for button text. under that it will ask for column name. column name field will automatically change when the two above fields change in the format "[button text (no spaces, pascal case)]Link[owner data object name of destination page]". The modal will have an 'Add' and cancel button. On click of Add, it will create a report column similar to this..."
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * Implemented complete "Add Destination Button Column" feature in report details view columns tab
  * Added button immediately left of existing "Add Column" button
  * Modal implementation:
    - Created addDestinationButtonColumnModalTemplate.js with destination page input, browse button, button text field, auto-generated column name
    - Created addDestinationButtonColumnModalFunctionality.js with auto-generation logic and validation
    - Integrated with existing page search modal functionality
    - Added click handler in columnManagementFunctions.js
    - Updated mainTemplate.js and clientScriptTemplate.js to include new modal
  * Backend implementation:

    - Created addDestinationButtonColumnToReport() function with proper column structure generation
    - Implemented sourceObjectName logic using target child object or report owner fallback
    - Added destinationContextObjectName resolution using page owner object lookup
  * Generated column structure matches TODO example: name, buttonText, destinationContextObjectName, destinationTargetName, isButton="true", sourceObjectName, sourcePropertyName="Code", sqlServerDBDataType="nvarchar(50)"
  * Integration: Uses existing patterns for modal creation, message handling, and UI refresh

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Fix FK Object Name browse button not enabled when checkbox is manually checked
- Command: "if a check a checkbox i then cannot click browse button"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED 
- Architecture Notes:
  * Root Cause: Checkbox change event handler in parameterManagementFunctions.js was missing fKObjectName browse button logic
  * Problem: When user manually checks fKObjectName checkbox, no event handler was enabling the browse button
  * Solution: Added fKObjectName browse button state management to checkbox change event handler (lines 140-147)
  * Pattern: Each field with browse button needs logic in both:
    - Initial parameter selection handler (for when property already exists)
    - Checkbox change event handler (for when user manually checks/unchecks)
- Code Added: Browse button enable/disable logic in checkbox.addEventListener('change') for fKObjectName field
- Build Status: Compiled successfully with webpack
- Testing: Checkbox check → browse button enabled, checkbox uncheck → browse button disabled

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Fix FK Object Name browse button disabled state
- Command: "the browse button is now visible, but its disabled"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED 
- Architecture Notes:
  * Root Cause: parameterManagementFunctions.js had logic to set browse button state for sourceObjectName but missing for fKObjectName
  * Solution: Added browse button state initialization for fKObjectName field in parameter selection handler
  * Code Added: Browse button state logic in parameterManagementFunctions.js lines 75-81
  * Pattern: When parameter is selected, checkbox state determines browse button enabled/disabled state
  * Logic Flow: param selected → property exists check → checkbox checked → browse button enabled
- Build Status: Compiled successfully with webpack
- Next Steps: Refresh Form Details webview to test browse button functionality

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Fix FK Object Name browse button not visible due to case sensitivity issue
- Command: "Form details view: Input controls tab: 'fk object name' setting: 'browse data objects' button its not visible"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * Root Cause: Code was checking for "fkObjectName" (lowercase k) but schema uses "fKObjectName" (capital K)
  * Fixed case sensitivity issue in 5 files:
    - paramsListTemplate.js: Updated propKey comparison to "fKObjectName"
    - paramsTableTemplate.js: Updated paramKey comparison to "fKObjectName" 
    - domInitialization.js: Updated propKey comparison to "fKObjectName"
    - formControlUtilities.js: Updated propertyName comparison to "fKObjectName" (both enable/disable cases)
    - uiEventHandlers.js: Updated propertyName comparison to "fKObjectName"
  * Browse button should now appear for FK Object Name field when property checkbox is checked
- Pattern: Case-sensitive property name matching - schema property names must match exactly in JavaScript comparisons
- Build Status: Compiled successfully with webpack

2025-01-25: ✅ COMPLETED - Fix destinationContextObjectName not being set for button creation
- Command: "destinationContextObjectName is not being set"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * Fixed issue where destinationContextObjectName and destinationTargetName were not initialized for regular buttons
  * Added empty string initialization for these fields in addButtonToReport() and addButtonToReportWithName() functions
  * Added empty string initialization for form buttons in addButtonToFormWithText() function
  * Enhanced debugging for addBreadcrumbToReport() to help diagnose when getPageOwnerObject() returns null
  * Root cause: Regular buttons need these fields available in UI for user to populate when creating navigation buttons
  * For breadcrumb buttons: destinationContextObjectName is automatically populated via getPageOwnerObject()
  * For regular buttons: destinationContextObjectName and destinationTargetName start as empty strings for user to fill
  * This ensures all button types have consistent field structure matching the schema
- Files Modified:
  * src/webviews/reports/reportDetailsView.js - Added field initialization and enhanced debugging
  * src/webviews/forms/formDetailsView.js - Added field initialization for form buttons
- Testing: Code compiles successfully, all button creation functions now properly initialize navigation fields

2025-01-25: ✅ COMPLETED - Add isVisible, isEnabled, and isButtonCallToAction properties to report button creation functions
- Command: "review the report details view buttons tab 'add breadcrumb' button. add these items too... isVisible: "true", isEnabled: "true", isButtonCallToAction: "false""

- Architecture Notes:
  * Updated addBreadcrumbToReport() function to include the three new properties when creating breadcrumb buttons
  * Updated addButtonToReport() function to include the three new properties when creating default buttons  
  * Updated addButtonToReportWithName() function to include the three new properties when creating named buttons
  * Updated addButtonToFormWithText() function in formDetailsView.js to include isVisible and isButtonCallToAction (isEnabled not available for form buttons per schema)
  * All properties set to default values: isVisible="true", isEnabled="true" (reports only), isButtonCallToAction="false"
  * Properties are defined in app-dna.schema.json for reportButton and objectWorkflowButton items as string enums with "true"/"false" values
  * Ensures consistent button creation with proper default visibility, enabled state, and call-to-action styling across both reports and forms
- Files Modified:
  * src/webviews/reports/reportDetailsView.js - Updated all three button creation functions to include new properties
  * src/webviews/forms/formDetailsView.js - Updated addButtonToFormWithText() function to include available properties
- Testing: Code compiles successfully, maintains existing functionality while adding proper default property values

2025-01-25: ✅ COMPLETED - Hide 'Is Exposed In Business Object' setting in form details view settings tab
- Added "isexposedinbusinessobject" to getFormPropertiesToIgnore() function in settingsTabTemplate.js
- Property isExposedInBusinessObject (schema description: "Defines access to business logic functionality") no longer appears in form settings tab
- Minimal change: Added 1 line to existing property filtering list following established pattern
- Build and lint verification: All tests pass, no new warnings introduced
- Architecture: Consistent with existing property hiding patterns used in reports and objects settings tabs

2025-01-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Form details view: input controls tab: missing the fkObjectName setting (Issue #227)
- Command: "Form details view: input controls tab: missing the fkObjectName setting"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture: Implemented complete fkObjectName field visibility and browse functionality for Forms webview input controls tab
- Components Modified:
  * Updated paramsListTemplate.js to remove "fkobjectname" from getParamPropertiesToHide() function
  * Added browse button for fkObjectName field with same pattern as sourceObjectName
  * Updated paramsTableTemplate.js to remove "fkobjectname" from hidden properties and add browse button
  * Updated domInitialization.js to handle fkObjectName browse button clicks via createDataObjectSearchModal
  * Updated formControlUtilities.js to manage browse button state (enable/disable) when fkObjectName property checkbox is toggled
  * Updated uiEventHandlers.js to set initial browse button state for fkObjectName field during page initialization
- Pattern: Followed exact same implementation pattern as existing sourceObjectName field implementation
- Data Integration: Reuses existing allDataObjects data and createDataObjectSearchModal functionality
- Button Management: Browse button state properly synchronized with property existence checkbox
- Modal Functionality: Uses existing dataObjectSearchModalTemplate.js and dataObjectSearchModalFunctionality.js with text filter
- Result: Users can now see and configure fkObjectName field in Forms webview input controls tab, with browse data objects functionality
- Status: Compiled successfully, ready for testing

2025-01-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Reports Webview "Browse Data Objects" Button Implementation for sourceObjectName Field in Columns Tab

- Data Integration: Reuses existing allDataObjects data and createDataObjectSearchModal functionality
- Button Management: Browse button state properly synchronized with property existence checkbox
- Modal Functionality: Uses existing dataObjectSearchModalTemplate.js and dataObjectSearchModalFunctionality.js with text filter
- Result: Users can now see and configure sourceObjectName field in Reports webview columns tab, with browse data objects functionality
- Status: Compiled successfully, ready for testing
- Command: "Page preview view: Form preview: Lookup dropdown item list update"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture: Enhanced page preview form generation to show actual lookup items instead of sample data
- Issue: When IsFKList=true, page preview showed hardcoded "Sample Option 1/2" instead of actual lookup items from fkObjectName data object
- Solution Implemented:
  * Added getLookupItemsForFKObject() helper function to extract lookup items from FK data objects
  * Modified generateFormInput() to use actual lookup data from allObjects when IsFKList=true
  * Updated generateFilterInput() for report filters to use same lookup data logic
  * Added proper handling for both fKObjectName and fkObjectName property variations
  * Implemented filtering to show only active lookup items (isActive="true")
  * Added fallback messages when FK object not found or has no lookup items
  * Enhanced debug logging to help troubleshoot FK dropdown generation
- Data Flow: allObjects → getLookupItemsForFKObject(fkObjectName) → dropdown options (name, displayName, description)
- Lookup Item Properties Used:
  * name: option value
  * displayName: visible text (fallback to name if not set)
  * description: tooltip text
  * isActive: filter out inactive items
- Edge Cases Handled:
  * FK object name not found: shows "No items found in [objectName]"
  * FK object has no lookup items: shows informative message
  * Missing fkObjectName: graceful degradation
- Components Modified:
  * src/webviews/pagepreview/components/htmlGenerator.js - main implementation
- Result: FK dropdown controls now show real lookup data instead of sample data
- Status: Compiled successfully, enhanced with debug logging for troubleshooting

2025-01-16: ✅ FIXED - Lookup Button Hover Styling
- Problem: Lookup button showed dark blue background on hover (using vscode-button-hoverBackground)
- Solution: Removed background color change on hover, replaced with subtle border color change
- Updated: .control-with-button .lookup-button:hover to use border-color: var(--vscode-focusBorder)
- Result: More subtle hover effect without dark blue background
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

2025-01-16: ✅ FIXED - Destination Target Name Control Width Consistency
- Problem: destinationTargetName field with browse button was narrower than other setting controls
- Root Cause: .control-with-button container didn't have flex: 1 in form-row context
- Solution: Added .form-row .control-with-button to CSS flex styling rules
- Result: destinationTargetName control now matches width of other form controls
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

2025-01-16: ✅ FIXED - Button Settings Control Width Issue
- Problem: All button setting controls were wrapped in .control-with-button container, affecting width
- Root Cause: List template was applying .control-with-button to all fields, not just destinationTargetName
- Solution: Modified buttonsListTemplate.js to conditionally apply .control-with-button only when browse button exists
- Added: Proper flex styling for form-row input fields (flex: 1, min-width: 0)
- Result: Setting controls return to normal width, browse buttons only appear for destinationTargetName
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

2025-01-16: ✅ COMPLETED - "Browse for Page" Modal Implementation for destinationTargetName Field
- Created pageSearchModalTemplate.js with filter dropdown (Forms/Reports) and page list selection

- Added second subscription checkbox below owner subscription checkbox in input controls tab of form details view
- Checkbox controls target child object's propSubscription entries with destinationContextObjectName=TargetChildObjectName, destinationTargetName=FormName
- When checked: sets isIgnored="false" (or creates new entry if none exists)
- When unchecked: sets isIgnored="true" (creates entry if needed)
- Checkbox is automatically disabled when no targetChildObject is set on the form
- Added ModelService.getFormTargetChildObject() method to find target child object by form's targetChildObject property
- Added JavaScript handlers: initializeTargetChildSubscriptionCheckbox(), handleTargetChildSubscriptionToggle(), updateTargetChildSubscription()
- Added backend functions: getFormTargetChildSubscriptionState() and updateFormTargetChildSubscription()
- Added message handlers: getFormTargetChildSubscriptionState, updateFormTargetChildSubscription, setFormTargetChildSubscriptionState
- Uses same CSS styling as existing subscription controls (existing .subscription-controls styling)
- Checkbox state automatically initialized on tab load by querying current target child propSubscription
- Properly handles edge cases: missing target child object, missing propSubscription array, etc.

- Properly handles edge cases: missing propSubscription array, missing owner object, etc.
Architecture Notes:
- Checkbox state automatically initialized on tab load by querying current propSubscription
- Uses owner object's propSubscription array (not report's) per specification

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Form details view: Display page init flow (Issue #259)
- Added page initialization flow display section above owner data object section in form details view
- Format: "Page Initialization Flow: [value]" when initObjectWorkflowName property exists and is set
- Implementation details:
  * Modified mainTemplate.js to add conditional page-init-flow-section before owner-data-object-section
  * Added CSS styling matching the existing design with page-init-flow-label and page-init-flow-name classes
  * Used conditional rendering: ${form.initObjectWorkflowName ? `...` : ''} to only show when property exists
  * Positioned correctly between header and owner object display as specified
  * Follows VS Code design language with proper CSS variables for consistent styling
  * Gracefully handles cases where initObjectWorkflowName doesn't exist (section hidden)
- Architecture Notes:
  * Template receives form object directly with initObjectWorkflowName property from ObjectWorkflowModel
  * CSS classes follow existing naming convention: page-init-flow-section, page-init-flow-label, page-init-flow-name
  * Consistent spacing and layout with existing owner-data-object-section styling
  * No functional changes needed - purely display enhancement
- Testing: Created comprehensive tests covering property exists/doesn't exist/empty value scenarios

- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Problem: Form details view was calling 'appdna.showObjectDetails' command but only 'appdna.showDetails' command was registered
- Root Cause: Incorrect command name used in formDetailsView.js line 481
- Solution: Updated formDetailsView.js to use correct command name 'appdna.showDetails' instead of 'appdna.showObjectDetails'
- Architecture: Command registration in registerCommands.ts uses 'appdna.showDetails' and calls objectDetailsView.showObjectDetails function
- Result: Owner data object edit button will now work correctly without command not found error
- Status: Fixed - command name corrected

2025-08-16: ✅ FIXED - Reports Webview Browse Button Inactive Issue
- Problem: Browse button for 'Destination Target Name' was inactive/disabled in Reports webview

  * Added setupPageBrowseButtonHandlers() function with event delegation for .lookup-button clicks
  * Added call to setupPageBrowseButtonHandlers() in DOM initialization
  * Event handler finds input field using data-field-id attribute and calls createPageSearchModal()
  * Handles both list view and table view browse button clicks
- Pattern: Copied exact same click handling logic from Forms webview for consistency
- Integration: Click events now properly trigger the page search modal functionality
- Result: Browse button clicks now open the "Browse for Page" modal as expected

    - Added browse button state management in table checkbox handlers (both checked/unchecked)
  * Existing domInitialization.js setupPageBrowseButtonHandlers() already handles column browse buttons
- Pattern: Reused same browse button implementation from buttons tab for consistency
- Integration: Browse button state properly synchronized with property existence checkboxes in both list and table views
- Result: Report columns tab now has same "Browse for Page" functionality as buttons tab for destinationTargetName field
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

2025-08-16: ✅ FIXED - Browse Button Modal Changes Not Setting 'Unsaved Changes' Flag
- Problem: Changes made using browse button and modal did not trigger the 'unsaved changes' flag
- Root Cause: Column management functions only listened for 'input' events, but modal dispatches 'change' events
- Solution: Added 'change' event listeners to column input fields in columnManagementFunctions.js:
  * Added field.addEventListener('change', updateInputHandler) for column list view inputs
  * Change events now trigger the same update logic as input events
  * Both 'input' and 'change' events now properly update the model and mark unsaved changes
- Analysis: Button management functions already had both 'input' and 'change' listeners, so they worked correctly
- Backend: updateButtonDirectly() and updateColumnDirectly() both call modelService.markUnsavedChanges()
- Result: Browse button modal changes now properly trigger the 'unsaved changes' flag for both buttons and columns
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

Date: 2025-08-17
Command: Handle missing report.isPage as true

STATUS: COMPLETED

Changes Made:
1. Made ModelService.isPageReport() method public to allow external access
2. Updated ModelService.getAllPages() to use isPageReport() helper instead of direct comparison
3. Updated ModelService.getPageOwnerObject() to use isPageReport() helper instead of direct comparison
4. Updated userStoriesJourneyCommands.ts to use modelService.isPageReport() instead of report.isPage === "true"
5. Updated userStoriesPageMappingCommands.ts (3 locations) to use modelService.isPageReport() instead of report.isPage === "true"

Architecture Notes:
- The isPageReport() helper function already existed in ModelService and correctly handles the logic: report.isPage === "true" || report.isPage === undefined
- Making it public allows other command files to use the same centralized logic
- All report.isPage checks now consistently treat missing isPage as true across the codebase
- Workflow.isPage checks were left unchanged per user request to focus only on reports

Files Modified:
- src/services/modelService.ts
- src/commands/userStoriesJourneyCommands.ts  
- src/commands/userStoriesPageMappingCommands.ts

The changes ensure that throughout the codebase, missing report.isPage properties are consistently treated as if the value is 'true', providing a better default behavior for reports that don't explicitly set this property.
