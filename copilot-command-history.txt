USER REQUEST: "user story requirement fulfillments view downlaod to csv button shoudl open the csv immediately"
**Status**:  COMPLETED

**Changes Made**:
1. Modified equirementsFulfillmentCommands.ts in 'saveCsvToWorkspace' case
   - Added automatic file opening after CSV save operation
   - Added scode.window.showTextDocument(fileUri) to open CSV immediately
   - Pattern matches other views like workflowListCommands.ts

**Technical Details**:
- CSV download flow: webview  'exportToCSV'  extension generates CSV  'csvExportReady'  webview sends 'saveCsvToWorkspace'  extension saves and now opens file
- Uses same pattern as other list views for consistency
- File opens in VS Code editor immediately after successful save

**Architecture Notes**:
- Maintains consistent UX across all CSV export functionality
- No changes to webview logic required - only extension command handler
- File path constructed using workspace root and filename from message data
