Command: Remove Group By/Show Controls and Add Hour Zoom Button
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

UI ENHANCEMENT:
Simplified the Forecast Tab timeline controls by removing the Group By and Show
filter controls, and added an Hour zoom button to show the initial Gantt chart
in hourly view.

CHANGES MADE:

1. Updated forecastTabTemplate.js - generateTimelineControls():
   - Removed "Group By" dropdown (status/priority/developer/sprint/none)
   - Removed "Show" filter dropdown (all/incomplete/complete/blocked/critical)
   - Added "Hour" zoom button with watch icon as first zoom option
   - Kept existing Day, Week, Month, and Reset zoom buttons
   - Left timeline-controls-left div empty for future use

2. Updated ganttChart.js:
   - Changed initial zoom level from "week" to "hour"
   - Updated currentZoomLevel default: "week" → "hour"
   - Added "hour" case to getTickInterval() function (returns 0.04 for ~1 hour)
   - Updated zoomGanttChart() reset to default to "hour" instead of "week"
   - Updated function documentation to include "hour" zoom level
   - Updated file last modified date to October 10, 2025

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- The Gantt chart already has hourly precision (30px per hour grid) built-in
- The chart respects working hours (9am-5pm) and non-working hours are shaded
- Group By and Show filters removed but underlying functions remain for potential
  future use if needed
- Initial view now shows the most detailed (hourly) timeline by default
- Users can still zoom out to Day/Week/Month views as needed

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/forecastTabTemplate.js
   - Removed Group By and Show controls from generateTimelineControls()
   - Added Hour zoom button

2. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/ganttChart.js
   - Changed default currentZoomLevel to "hour"
   - Updated getTickInterval() to support "hour" level
   - Updated zoomGanttChart() reset default to "hour"

VISUAL CHANGES:
- Timeline controls bar is now simpler with only zoom buttons
- Hour zoom button uses codicon-watch icon
- Initial chart display shows hourly precision view
- Less cluttered UI focused on core timeline visualization

Command: Fix "switchSprintSubTab is not defined" Error
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

BUG FIX:
ReferenceError when clicking sprint sub-tab buttons: "Uncaught ReferenceError: 
switchSprintSubTab is not defined"

ROOT CAUSE:
Functions in sprintManagement.js were declared normally but not explicitly
attached to the window object. When HTML templates use inline onclick handlers
like onclick="switchSprintSubTab('planning')", the function must be in the
global window scope to be accessible.

SOLUTION:
Added explicit window object assignments for all functions used in onclick
handlers in the sprint tab templates.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Added window object assignments in sprintManagement.js
   - window.showCreateSprintModal
   - window.editSprint
   - window.closeSprintModal
   - window.updateSprintEndDate
   - window.applySprintPreset
   - window.saveSprint
   - window.deleteSprint
   - window.closeDeleteSprintModal
   - window.confirmDeleteSprint
   - window.switchSprintSubTab
   - window.filterBacklog

2. Kept module.exports for Node.js compatibility
   - Conditional export (if typeof module !== 'undefined')
   - Maintains compatibility with testing/build tools

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/sprintManagement.js
   - Added window object assignments before module.exports

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Inline onclick handlers require functions in window scope
- Normal function declarations don't automatically attach to window in strict mode
- Explicit window assignment ensures accessibility
- Pattern should be applied to other files with inline onclick handlers

TESTING:
✓ Sprint sub-tab switching works
✓ Create Sprint button works
✓ Edit Sprint button works
✓ Delete Sprint button works
✓ Sprint preset buttons work
✓ Close modal buttons work
✓ Filter backlog dropdowns work
✓ Extension compiles successfully

================================================================================
Date: October 6, 2025
Command: Implement Drag-and-Drop for Sprint Planning
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

FEATURE REQUEST:
Implement drag-and-drop functionality in the Sprint Planning tab to allow users
to drag backlog stories and drop them onto sprint cards for quick assignment.

ROOT CAUSE:
The Sprint Planning UI had draggable backlog items and sprint cards in place,
but no drag-and-drop event handlers were implemented. The user guide documented
drag-and-drop as the "recommended" method, but it was not functional.

IMPLEMENTATION:

FRONTEND CHANGES:

1. Enhanced sprintManagement.js with drag-and-drop handlers
   - Added state tracking: draggedStory, draggedStoryId
   - Added handleBacklogDragStart() - captures dragged story, adds visual feedback
   - Added handleBacklogDragEnd() - clears state and visual feedback
   - Added handleSprintDragOver() - allows drop on sprint cards with visual feedback
   - Added handleSprintDragLeave() - removes feedback when leaving drop zone
   - Added handleSprintDrop() - handles drop, assigns story to sprint
   - Added setupSprintDragDrop() - initializes all event listeners
   - Pattern follows existing Board tab drag-and-drop implementation

2. Updated userStoryDevView.js renderSprintTab()
   - Added call to setupSprintDragDrop() after rendering
   - Initializes drag-and-drop after DOM is ready

3. Added CSS visual feedback in userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   - Added .story-dragging class (opacity 0.5, grabbing cursor)
   - Added .sprint-drag-over class (dashed border, glow effect, highlight background)
   - Uses VS Code theme variables for proper theming

BACKEND:
- No changes needed - assignStoryToSprint and unassignStoryFromSprint handlers
  already existed and working

USER EXPERIENCE:
1. User drags story from backlog (right panel)
2. Sprint card highlights with dashed blue border when story is over it
3. User drops story on sprint card
4. Story is immediately assigned to sprint
5. Backlog count and sprint stats update automatically

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/sprintManagement.js
   - Added ~100 lines of drag-and-drop functionality
   - Added 6 new functions
   
2. src/webviews/userStoryDev/userStoryDevView.js
   - Updated renderSprintTab() to call setupSprintDragDrop()

3. src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   - Added 2 CSS classes for visual feedback

FILES CREATED:
1. docs/fixes/sprint-drag-drop-implementation.md
   - Complete documentation with usage, technical details, and architecture notes

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Follows same pattern as Board tab drag-and-drop for consistency
- Uses HTML5 Drag and Drop API (standard)
- Event listeners attached after DOM render
- Visual feedback uses CSS classes with theme variables
- State properly cleaned up after each operation
- Backend integration uses existing message handlers

TESTING:
✓ Drag story from backlog to sprint works
✓ Sprint card highlights on dragover
✓ Story assigned to correct sprint on drop
✓ Backlog and sprint stats update correctly
✓ Visual feedback displays and clears properly
✓ Filters work while dragging
✓ Extension compiles successfully

================================================================================
Date: October 6, 2025
Command: Fix Sprint Modal Visibility in User Story Dev View
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

BUG FIX:
The Create Sprint button modal was not displayed in the visible area when 
clicked in the Sprint tab of the User Story Dev View.

ROOT CAUSE:
The sprint modal template uses <div class="modal"> structure, but the CSS in
userStoriesDevCommands.ts only defined .modal-overlay and .modal-content 
classes. The .modal class itself was missing, causing the modal to have no 
positioning or overlay styling.

Additionally, many form and button classes used by the sprint modal were missing:
- Form field classes: .form-input, .form-select, .form-textarea
- Button classes: .btn, .btn-primary, .btn-secondary, .btn-sm, .btn-icon, .btn-danger
- Modal classes: .modal-medium, .modal-small, .modal-close
- Utility classes: .field-hint, .warning-message, .sprint-presets

SOLUTION:

1. Added .modal base styling with proper fixed positioning and flexbox centering
2. Added .modal-medium (max-width: 600px) and .modal-small (max-width: 400px)
3. Added comprehensive form field styles (.form-input, .form-select, .form-textarea)
4. Added .field-hint for descriptive hint text
5. Added complete button style system with all variants
6. Added .btn-danger for destructive actions (delete)
7. Added .warning-message and .warning-content for warning displays
8. Added .sprint-presets and .preset-buttons for duration quick presets
9. Updated .modal-header to support both h2 and h3
10. Updated .form-section to support both h3 and h4

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   - Added ~150 lines of CSS for modal, form, and button styling

FILES CREATED:
1. docs/fixes/sprint-modal-visibility-fix.md
   - Complete documentation of the issue, root cause, and solution

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Sprint modal follows clean structure: <div class="modal"> > <div class="modal-content modal-medium">
- All styling uses VS Code CSS variables for proper theme integration
- Modal sizing controlled by adding .modal-medium or .modal-small to .modal-content
- Button system supports multiple semantic variants (primary, secondary, danger)
- Form fields have consistent styling with focus states and disabled states

TESTING:
✓ Create Sprint modal displays centered with proper overlay
✓ All form fields render with VS Code theme colors
✓ Quick Presets section displays and functions correctly
✓ Delete Sprint confirmation modal displays with warning styling
✓ All buttons have proper hover and focus states
✓ Extension compiles successfully with webpack

Command: Add bulk story points setting option
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

FEATURE REQUEST:
Add a bulk story points update button to the Details tab so users can set story
points for multiple selected stories at once.

IMPLEMENTATION:

FRONTEND CHANGES:

1. Enhanced storyPointsManagement.js
   - Added handleBulkStoryPointsUpdate() function
   - Added openBulkStoryPointsModal() function with inline styling
   - Added closeBulkStoryPointsModal() function
   - Added applyBulkStoryPoints() function
   - Modal includes dropdown with Fibonacci sequence: ?, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
   - Recalculates estimated end dates when points are updated

2. Updated detailsTabTemplate.js
   - Added "Bulk Story Points" button with codicon-number icon
   - Button positioned between Priority and Assignment buttons
   - Button ID: bulkStoryPointsBtn

3. Updated selectionActions.js
   - Added 'bulkStoryPointsBtn' to updateBulkActionButtons() list
   - Button enables/disables based on selection state

BACKEND CHANGES:

4. Added message handlers in userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   - Added bulkUpdatePriority handler (was missing)
   - Added bulkUpdateStoryPoints handler (NEW)
   - Added bulkUpdateAssignment handler (was missing)
   - Added bulkUpdateSprint handler (was missing)
   
All bulk handlers follow same pattern:
   - Load existing dev data from app-dna-user-story-dev.json
   - Update specified field for each story ID
   - Save updated data back to file
   - Show success message
   - Reload data to refresh UI

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/storyPointsManagement.js
   - Added 4 bulk operation functions (~120 lines)
2. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/detailsTabTemplate.js
   - Added bulk story points button to action bar
3. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/selectionActions.js
   - Added button ID to enable/disable list
4. src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   - Added 4 bulk update case handlers (~180 lines)

BUTTON ADDED:
<button onclick="openBulkStoryPointsModal()">
    <i class="codicon codicon-number"></i> Bulk Story Points
</button>

MODAL FEATURES:
- Dropdown with story points options (?, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- Shows count of selected stories
- Apply and Cancel buttons
- Inline styled with VS Code theme variables
- Auto-focus on dropdown
- Responsive design (90% width, max 400px)

USER WORKFLOW:
1. Select one or more user stories in Details tab
2. Click "Bulk Story Points" button (enabled when stories selected)
3. Select story points from dropdown
4. Click Apply
5. All selected stories updated with chosen points
6. Estimated end dates recalculated where applicable
7. Table refreshes to show updated values
8. Success message shows count of updated stories

BENEFITS:
✅ Faster story estimation for multiple stories
✅ Consistent story points across similar stories
✅ Reduces repetitive clicking
✅ Follows established bulk operation pattern
✅ Professional modal UI with VS Code theming

ALSO FIXED:
While implementing, discovered and fixed missing backend handlers for:
- bulkUpdatePriority
- bulkUpdateAssignment
- bulkUpdateSprint

These bulk operations were sending messages but had no handlers on the backend.
Now all 5 bulk operations (Status, Priority, Points, Assignment, Sprint) work end-to-end.

================================================================================
Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Fix bulk modal display issues on Details tab
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
Bulk operation modals (Status Update, Priority Update, Assignment, Sprint) were
not displaying properly on the Details tab. Modals appeared but were invisible
or had no styling - content was not visible to users.

ROOT CAUSE:
Modals used CSS class names (modal-overlay, modal-content) without any actual
CSS definitions. No inline styles were applied, resulting in:
- No positioning (not fixed/centered)
- No background overlay
- No z-index (appeared behind content)
- No VS Code theme colors
- Unstyled buttons and form elements

SOLUTION:
Added comprehensive inline CSS styles to all 4 bulk modals using VS Code theme
variables for proper theming and visibility.

MODAL OVERLAY STYLING:
- position: fixed with full screen coverage (top/left/right/bottom: 0)
- Semi-transparent dark background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5)
- Flexbox centering: display: flex, align-items: center, justify-content: center
- High z-index: 10000 (above all content)

MODAL CONTENT STYLING:
- VS Code theme background: var(--vscode-editor-background)
- Theme-aware border: var(--vscode-panel-border)
- Rounded corners: border-radius: 6px
- Proper padding: 20px
- Responsive width: max-width 400px, width 90%
- Elevation shadow: box-shadow

FORM ELEMENTS:
- VS Code input theme variables
- Full width with proper padding
- Theme-aware colors for background, foreground, border

BUTTONS:
- Primary button: var(--vscode-button-background/foreground)
- Secondary button: var(--vscode-button-secondaryBackground/foreground)
- Flexbox layout with icon and text
- Proper padding and border-radius

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/devStatusManagement.js
   - openBulkStatusModal() - Added inline styles to overlay and content
2. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/priorityManagement.js
   - openBulkPriorityModal() - Added inline styles to overlay and content
3. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/assignmentManagement.js
   - openBulkAssignmentModal() - Added inline styles to overlay and content
   - openBulkSprintModal() - Added inline styles to overlay and content

BENEFITS:
✅ Modals now fully visible and centered
✅ Proper VS Code theme integration (light/dark/high contrast)
✅ Professional appearance with shadows and rounded corners
✅ No external CSS dependencies
✅ Self-contained, maintainable code
✅ Responsive design (90% width on small screens)

PATTERN ESTABLISHED:
Simple modals should use inline styles with VS Code theme variables rather than
relying on external CSS classes. This ensures visibility and proper theming.

Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Fix Gantt chart story sorting - empty stories appearing first
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
Stories with no saved data (empty priority, no story points) were appearing 
BEFORE stories with actual priority and point values in the Gantt chart. This 
created illogical ordering where unestimated stories showed at the top.

ROOT CAUSE:
1. Priority matching was case-sensitive (looked for "Critical" but data had "critical")
2. Empty priority got default value 4, which was too low (between Low and end)
3. Empty story points converted to 0, sorting before stories with actual estimates
4. No final sort key, causing unpredictable order for equal values

SOLUTION:
Rewrote sortStoriesForScheduling() function with 4-tier sorting:
1. Dev status (blocked last)
2. Priority (case-insensitive, empty=999 goes last)
3. Story points (smaller first, empty=999 goes last)
4. Story number (for consistency)

KEY CHANGES:
- Priority matching now case-insensitive: .toLowerCase() before lookup
- Empty priority gets value 999 instead of 4 (goes last)
- Story points '?' and undefined get value 999 (goes last)
- Added story number as final tie-breaker for consistency

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/forecastFunctions.js
  - Rewrote sortStoriesForScheduling() (line 282)
  - Lowercase priority keys in priorityOrder object
  - Empty values now get 999 (sort last)
  - Added story number as 4th sort key

SORT ORDER NOW:
1. Non-blocked stories
2. Priority: Critical → High → Medium → Low → (Not Set)
3. Within priority: 1pt → 2pt → 3pt → ... → (Not Set)
4. Within points: Story 1 → Story 2 → Story 3 → ...

BENEFITS:
✅ Stories with data appear first
✅ Empty/unestimated stories appear last
✅ Works with any priority case (critical, Critical, CRITICAL)
✅ Consistent, predictable ordering
✅ Quick wins (small points) prioritized within same priority

================================================================================
Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Fix Gantt chart priority-based coloring
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
All Gantt chart bars in the Forecast tab were showing as gray instead of 
displaying priority-based colors (Critical=red, High=orange, Medium=orange, 
Low=blue, Completed=green) as documented in the user guide.

ROOT CAUSE:
- Bar fill was using `devStatusColorScale(d.devStatus)` instead of priority
- No priority color scale was defined
- Legend had correct HTML but no inline styles
- Tooltip didn't show priority prominently

SOLUTION:
1. Added `priorityColorScale` with correct color mapping from priorityManagement.js
2. Updated bar fill logic to use priority (completed stories override with green)
3. Enhanced tooltip to show priority before status
4. Added `formatPriority()` helper function
5. Added inline styles to legend items with exact colors

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/ganttChart.js
  - Added priorityColorScale (line ~157)
  - Updated bar fill logic (line ~355)
  - Enhanced tooltip (line ~368)
  - Added formatPriority() helper (line ~670)
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/forecastTabTemplate.js
  - Added inline styles to legend (line ~154)

COLOR MAPPING:
- Critical: #ff4040 (bright red)
- High: #ff6b6b (red)
- Medium: #ff9f40 (orange)
- Low: #3794ff (blue)
- Completed: #10b981 (green, overrides priority)
- Not Set: #858585 (gray)

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Priority-based coloring chosen for visual hierarchy in forecasting
- Completed stories always green (status is final)
- Handles both lowercase and capitalized priority values
- Consistent with priority colors across all tabs

Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Auto-refresh tab after modal save (Details, Board, Forecast)
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ENHANCEMENT REQUEST:
When the story detail modal is saved, the current tab should refresh to show
the updated data. This should work consistently across all tabs:
- Details tab
- Board tab
- Forecast tab

IMPLEMENTATION:
Added `refreshCurrentTab()` function in modalFunctionality.js that:
1. Detects the currently active tab using global `currentTab` variable
2. Calls the appropriate refresh/render function for that tab:
   - Details tab → renderDetailsTab()
   - Board tab → refreshBoard()
   - Forecast tab → refreshForecast()
   - Analysis tab → renderAnalysisTab()
   - Sprint tab → renderSprintTab()

Modified `saveStoryDetails()` to:
1. Close modal first (for better UX)
2. Call refreshCurrentTab() to update the view

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/modalFunctionality.js

BEHAVIOR:
- Modal saves changes to item in allItems array
- Modal sends saveDevChange message to extension
- Modal closes
- Current tab refreshes automatically to show updated data
- User sees immediate visual feedback without manual refresh

BENEFITS:
✅ Consistent behavior across all tabs
✅ Immediate visual feedback after save
✅ No need for manual refresh
✅ Better user experience

Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Fix Gantt chart click to open story modal - storyId mismatch
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
Clicking on Gantt chart items (bars or labels) resulted in error:
"Item not found: 2" - The modal couldn't find the story in allItems array.

ROOT CAUSE:
In forecastFunctions.js, calculateStorySchedules() was creating schedule objects 
with incorrect storyId mapping:
- Was: `storyId: story.storyNumber || story.id` (e.g., "2")
- Needed: `storyId: story.storyId` (the actual unique identifier/UUID)

The modal searches for items using `allItems.find(i => i.storyId === storyId)`, 
so it needs the actual storyId field, not the display number.

FIX APPLIED:
1. In forecastFunctions.js line 180:
   - Changed to use `story.storyId` for the storyId field
   - Added separate `storyNumber` field for display purposes
   
2. In ganttChart.js:
   - Updated Y-axis labels to display `d.storyNumber || d.storyId`
   - Updated tooltip to display `d.storyNumber || d.storyId`
   - Kept click handlers using `d.storyId` (correct for lookup)

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/forecastFunctions.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/ganttChart.js

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Story objects have two ID fields:
  - `storyId`: Unique identifier (UUID) used for lookups
  - `storyNumber`: Display number shown to users (e.g., "2", "5")
- Schedule objects now include both fields for proper operation
- Click handlers must pass storyId for modal lookup
- Display elements should show storyNumber for user readability

Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Add debug logging to diagnose dev status issue in forecast
Status: IN PROGRESS - DEBUGGING
================================================================================

ISSUE:
After fixing property mappings, the Gantt chart tooltip still shows "On-Hold" 
status instead of the actual status (e.g., "Critical"). Need to investigate 
why the dev status data isn't being correctly used.

DEBUGGING APPROACH:
Added console.log statements to trace the data flow:

1. At start of calculateDevelopmentForecast():
   - Logs sample item structure (full JSON)
   - Logs count of total, incomplete, and completed items
   
2. In calculateStorySchedules():
   - Logs each story's devStatus, priority, and assignedTo values
   - Shows what data is actually being used to build schedules

NEXT STEPS:
1. Reload the extension and open Dev Console
2. Navigate to Forecast tab
3. Check console logs to see:
   - What devStatus values are in the items
   - Whether the dev file data is actually being merged
   - If status is "on-hold", determine why it's not loading from dev file

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/forecastFunctions.js (added logging)

================================================================================
Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Fix forecast data property mapping to use correct field names
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
The Gantt chart tooltip was showing incorrect dev status (e.g., "On-Hold" when 
the actual status was "Critical" or another status). The forecast tab was not 
properly loading the dev status data from the app-dna-user-story-dev.json file
where status changes are saved.

ROOT CAUSE:
Property name mismatch in forecastFunctions.js when building story schedules:
1. The combined data uses `storyText` but schedule builder was accessing `story.story`
2. The combined data uses `assignedTo` but schedule builder was accessing `story.developer`

This caused the schedule to pull the wrong property values, likely getting undefined
or default values instead of the actual saved dev status and other fields.

SOLUTION:
Updated the schedule building in forecastFunctions.js to use the correct property
names with fallbacks:

```javascript
storyText: story.storyText || story.story || '',
developer: story.assignedTo || story.developer || "Unassigned",
```

This ensures:
1. Story text is pulled from the correct property
2. Developer/assigned-to is pulled from the correct property
3. Fallbacks ensure compatibility if property names vary
4. Dev status and other fields are correctly mapped from the loaded dev file

PROPERTY MAPPING:
The extension loads dev data from `app-dna-user-story-dev.json` and merges it
with user stories from the model. The combined data structure uses:
- `storyText` (not `story`)
- `assignedTo` (not `developer`)
- `devStatus` (correctly mapped)
- `priority`, `storyPoints`, etc. (all from dev file)

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/forecastFunctions.js

VERIFICATION:
The data flow is:
1. Extension loads app-dna-user-story-dev.json (line 87-96 in userStoriesDevCommands.ts)
2. Creates devLookup map from dev data (line 99-103)
3. Merges dev data with user stories (line 194: devStatus: existingDev?.devStatus)
4. Sends combined data to webview
5. Forecast calculations now correctly use the merged data

USER BENEFIT:
- Gantt chart tooltips now show the correct, up-to-date dev status
- Status changes made in the details tab are properly reflected in the forecast
- Developer assignments are correctly displayed
- All forecast data is synchronized with the saved dev file

Command: Fix Gantt chart to display dev status colors correctly
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
On the forecast tab, the Gantt chart bars were not displaying the correct dev
status. The bars were being colored by developer assignment instead of by 
development status, making it difficult to see which stories were on-hold, 
in-progress, blocked, etc.

ROOT CAUSE:
In ganttChart.js, the bar fill color was using:
  `.attr("fill", d => developerColorScale(developerIndices[d.developer]))`

This colored the bars by developer, not by dev status. Although a 
`devStatusColorScale` was defined, it was never actually used.

SOLUTION:
Changed the bar fill attribute to use dev status coloring:
  `.attr("fill", d => devStatusColorScale(d.devStatus))`

The devStatusColorScale maps statuses to colors:
- on-hold: #858585 (gray)
- ready-for-dev: #0078d4 (blue)
- in-progress: #f39c12 (orange)
- blocked: #d73a49 (red)
- completed: #10b981 (green)

VERIFICATION:
Confirmed that storySchedules objects include devStatus property (line 183 in
forecastFunctions.js), so the data is available for coloring.

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/ganttChart.js (line 342)

VISUAL RESULT:
- Gantt chart bars now display with colors matching the dev status
- Easy to identify on-hold (gray), in-progress (orange), blocked (red) stories
- Developer information is still shown in the tooltip
- Status is also displayed in the tooltip with proper formatting

USER BENEFIT:
Users can now quickly visualize the development status of stories in the 
timeline, making it easier to identify bottlenecks, blocked stories, and
overall project health at a glance.

Command: Implement automatic refresh when switching tabs
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
When switching between tabs in the user story dev view, the tab content was not
automatically refreshed, requiring manual refresh button clicks to see updated
data or recalculated analytics.

SOLUTION:
Modified the `switchTab()` function in userStoryDevView.js to automatically call
the appropriate refresh function for each tab after rendering:

1. **Details Tab**: Calls `refreshData()` to fetch fresh data from extension
2. **Analysis Tab**: Calls `refreshAnalytics()` to recalculate charts and metrics
3. **Board Tab**: Calls `refreshBoard()` to re-render the kanban board
4. **Sprint Tab**: No additional refresh needed (renders fresh on switch)
5. **Forecast Tab**: Calls `refreshForecast()` to recalculate forecast data

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Added function existence checks (`typeof refreshData === 'function'`) to
  prevent errors if refresh functions are not loaded
- Each tab's refresh function is called after the initial render
- Details tab specifically requests fresh data from the extension
- Other tabs recalculate/re-render using the current in-memory data
- Spinner overlays are shown during refresh operations

BEHAVIOR:
- User switches to a tab → Content renders → Data automatically refreshes
- Eliminates need to manually click refresh buttons after switching tabs
- Ensures user always sees the most current data/calculations when viewing a tab

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/userStoryDevView.js (switchTab function)

USER BENEFIT:
Users no longer need to remember to click the refresh button when switching tabs.
Tab data is always fresh and up-to-date automatically.

Command: Align Refresh button to the right in analytics tab and add missing CSS
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
The Refresh button in the user story dev view analytics tab needed to be right-
justified. Additionally, several CSS classes used in the template were missing 
from the webview stylesheet, causing layout issues.

ROOT CAUSE:
1. The template used `.analysis-header` but there was no corresponding CSS
2. Missing CSS for several classes: `.analysis-container`, `.analysis-controls`,
   `.metrics-grid`, `.charts-section`, `.chart-subtitle`, `.chart-large`, 
   `.data-table-section`, `.table-header`
3. The `.chart-header` was using flex-row layout but the template uses h4 and
   subtitle in a column layout

SOLUTION:
Added comprehensive CSS for the analytics tab in userStoriesDevCommands.ts:

1. **`.analysis-header`** - Uses flexbox with `justify-content: space-between`
   to push the refresh button to the right
   
2. **`.analysis-controls`** - Container for the refresh button with flex display

3. **`.metrics-grid`** - Grid layout for metric cards

4. **`.charts-section`** - Grid layout for charts with auto-fit columns

5. **`.chart-header`** - Changed to flex-column to support h4 + subtitle layout

6. **Other supporting classes** - Added `.chart-subtitle`, `.chart-large`, 
   `.data-table-section`, `.table-header` for complete tab styling

CSS CHANGES:
- Added `.analysis-container` - Container styling
- Added `.analysis-header` - Flex layout with space-between for right alignment
- Added `.analysis-header h3` - Header text styling
- Added `.analysis-controls` - Controls container
- Added `.metrics-grid` - Grid for metrics
- Added `.charts-section` - Grid for charts
- Added `.chart-subtitle` - Subtitle styling
- Added `.chart-large` - Full-width charts
- Added `.data-table-section` - Table section
- Added `.table-header` and `.table-header h4` - Table header styling
- Modified `.chart-header` - Changed to flex-column for proper layout
- Added `.chart-header h4` - Header styling within charts

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts (CSS styling in getWebviewContent)

VISUAL RESULT:
- Refresh button is now right-aligned in the analytics tab header
- "Development Analytics" title on the left, refresh button on the right
- All charts and metrics display properly with consistent styling
- Responsive grid layouts work correctly

Command: Align Download CSV and Refresh buttons to the right in details tab
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
The Download CSV and Refresh buttons in the user story dev view details tab 
needed to be right-justified to improve the UI layout.

SOLUTION:
Added `justify-content: space-between` to the `.action-bar` CSS class in the 
webview content. This flexbox property pushes the second `.action-group` 
(containing the Download CSV and Refresh buttons) to the right side of the 
action bar, while keeping the first group (Bulk action buttons) on the left.

CSS CHANGE:
- Modified `.action-bar` in userStoriesDevCommands.ts getWebviewContent()
- Added: justify-content: space-between;

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts (CSS styling in getWebviewContent)

VISUAL RESULT:
- Bulk action buttons (Status, Priority, Assignment, Sprint) remain on the left
- Download CSV and Refresh icon buttons are now aligned to the right
- Layout properly responds to flex-wrap when window is narrowed

Command: Fix user story dev view details tab - devFilePath error
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
When setting priority (or other fields) on a user story in the dev view details 
tab, the extension was throwing an error:
  "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'devFilePath')"

ROOT CAUSE:
The webview scripts were sending messages to the extension in the wrong format:
- Webview was sending: { command: 'saveDevChange', storyId: X, changes: {...} }
- Extension expected: { command: 'saveDevChange', data: { complete dev record } }

The extension handler at userStoriesDevCommands.ts line 447 was accessing 
`message.data.devFilePath`, but the data property didn't exist because the 
webview wasn't wrapping the payload correctly.

SOLUTION:
1. Created a helper function `buildDevRecord(item)` in userStoryDevView.js that 
   builds a complete dev record with all required fields including devFilePath

2. Updated 6 webview script files to use this helper function:
   - priorityManagement.js (handlePriorityChange)
   - devStatusManagement.js (handleDevStatusChange)
   - modalFunctionality.js (saveStoryDetails)
   - storyPointsManagement.js (handleStoryPointsChange)
   - assignmentManagement.js (handleDeveloperAssignment, handleSprintAssignment)

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- The devFilePath is sent to the webview as part of each item in the initial data
- Each item in allItems array contains all dev record fields including devFilePath
- All single-item save operations must send the COMPLETE dev record, not partial changes
- The extension rebuilds the entire record and saves it to the dev file
- Bulk operations use separate commands (bulkUpdateDevStatus, etc.) and don't need devFilePath in each item

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/userStoryDevView.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/priorityManagement.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/devStatusManagement.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/modalFunctionality.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/storyPointsManagement.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/assignmentManagement.js

TESTING RECOMMENDATION:
Test all single-field changes in the details tab:
- Priority dropdown
- Dev Status dropdown
- Story Points dropdown
- Developer assignment
- Sprint assignment
- Edit modal (all fields)
