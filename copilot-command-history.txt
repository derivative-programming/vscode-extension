August 3, 2025 - Role Requirements View Enhancement - COMPLETED

COMPLETED: Fix Role Requirements Apply Button View Update Issue
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Problem: Apply button in Role Requirements view was not updating the table display after bulk access changes
- Root Cause: Missing renderTable() call after bulk changes were applied to local data
- Architecture: Webview message passing pattern with local data updates and separate table rendering
- Files Modified:
  * src/webviews/roleRequirementsView.js - Added renderTable() call in apply button click handler
- Solution: Added renderTable() after bulk access changes to refresh the table display immediately
- Impact: Users can now see updated access levels in the table immediately after clicking "Apply to Selected"
- Technical Notes: handleAccessChange() updates local data arrays but doesn't trigger UI refresh - requires manual renderTable() call

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Redesigned Role Requirements View to Match Page List Design
- User request: "review the user story role requirements view. we are going to redesign it. it will have the same design as the page list view" and "The column is not 'story text', the column is 'Data Object' use names of all data objects. textbox filter" and "values for access will be stored in a separate app-dna-user-story-role-requirements.json file"
- Final specification: Table with columns Role | Data Object | Action | Access, showing all combinations
- Solution: Complete redesign following page list view patterns
  - Created roleRequirementsCommands.ts with full command registration and data loading
  - Created roleRequirementsView.js with table rendering, filtering, and inline editing
  - Table shows all combinations of roles × data objects × actions (View All, View, Add, Update, Delete)
  - Access column has inline dropdowns (Unassigned, Allowed, Required, Not Allowed)
  - Filter section with Role dropdown, Data Object textbox, Action dropdown, Access dropdown
  - Auto-saves changes to separate app-dna-user-story-role-requirements.json file
  - Uses exact same visual design as page list (header, filter section, table container, footer)
  - Sortable columns, refresh functionality, record count display, spinner loading
- BUG FIX: Fixed ModelService API usage error
  - Issue: "TypeError: modelService.getModel is not a function"
  - Root cause: Incorrect API call - method is getCurrentModel(), not getModel()
  - Solution: Updated to use proper ModelService methods (getAllObjects, getAllForms, getAllReports)
- Files: 
  - src/commands/roleRequirementsCommands.ts (complete implementation)
  - src/webviews/roleRequirementsView.js (JavaScript webview matching page list patterns)
  - src/commands/registerCommands.ts (updated imports and command registration)
  - package.json (added command definition with shield icon)
  - src/providers/jsonTreeDataProvider.ts (updated tree view to use new command)
- Data Structure: Separate JSON file with roleRequirements array containing role, dataObject, action, access fields
- Architecture: Follows pageListView patterns exactly for consistency across extension

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Implemented User Story Role Requirements view and command
- User request: "On click of the 'Role Requirements' item open a new 'User Story - Role Requirementviews'" and "call it UserStoryRoleRequirements instead of RoleRequirements" and "rename the two new files too"
- Solution: Created complete role requirements functionality with proper naming and file structure
  - Created userStoryRoleRequirementsView.js with showUserStoryRoleRequirementsView function
  - Created userStoryRoleRequirementsView.ts TypeScript wrapper
  - Added command 'appdna.showUserStoryRoleRequirements' to registerCommands.ts
  - Updated tree view to use new command name
  - Implemented panel tracking, cleanup, and reopen functionality
  - Created webview with overview of data objects and coming soon notice for full interface
  - Renamed files from roleRequirementsView.* to userStoryRoleRequirementsView.*
- Files created/modified: 
  - src/webviews/userStoryRoleRequirementsView.js (new, renamed from roleRequirementsView.js)
  - src/webviews/userStoryRoleRequirementsView.ts (new, renamed from roleRequirementsView.ts)
  - src/commands/registerCommands.ts (updated imports and command registration)
  - src/providers/jsonTreeDataProvider.ts (updated command reference)
- Architecture: Following established webview pattern with JS/TS wrapper, proper panel management, and VS Code integration

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Added 'Role Requirements' item to USER STORIES section
- User request: "add a 'Role Requirements' item above 'Stories'"
- Solution: Added new 'Role Requirements' item as first child of USER STORIES section, positioned above existing Stories item
- New item uses contextValue 'userStoriesRoleRequirements' and command 'appdna.showRoleRequirements'
- File modified: src/providers/jsonTreeDataProvider.ts
- Architecture: Extended USER STORIES section with role requirements management capability
- Note: Command 'appdna.showRoleRequirements' needs to be implemented in registerCommands.ts and corresponding view created

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Tree view restructure - Added USER STORIES section and moved Stories
- User request: "review the treeview. add a 'User Stories' treeview item above the 'Data Objects' item. Move the 'user stories' item under the 'Project' item under it and rename it to 'Stories'"
- Solution: 
  - Added new top-level 'USER STORIES' item between PROJECT and DATA OBJECTS
  - Moved existing 'User Stories' from under PROJECT to be child of new USER STORIES section
  - Renamed moved item from 'User Stories' to 'Stories'
  - Updated tree hierarchy order: PROJECT → USER STORIES → DATA OBJECTS → [PAGES] → MODEL SERVICES
  - Updated expandAllItems(), getParent(), and documentation
- Files modified: src/providers/jsonTreeDataProvider.ts, docs/architecture/tree-view-structure.md
- Architecture: Extended tree view structure with dedicated user stories section, maintaining existing command binding

2025-08-02: for a report grid view filter of datetime i see a dropdown
2025-08-02: check the display of report grid filters too
2025-08-02: review the page preview details view. on a form preview make sure a control of data type 'datetime' shows a date picker and time picker. on date type 'date' its just a date picker
2025-08-02: on sql server data type properties we show a dropdown on many views. The items in this dropdown should be in alpha order
2025-08-02: i see data object details view props tab prop setting Sql Server DB Data Type: dropdown as unsorted
2025-08-02: its the data object details view properties tab list view
2025-08-02: COMPLETED: Fixed all dropdown sorting across entire extension
- User request expanded from SQL Server data type dropdowns to "all tabs of the form details view as well" and "all dropdowns, not just sql server data type"
- Solution: Applied consistent pattern of .slice().sort() before .map() to alphabetically sort all enum-based dropdowns
- Files modified: 

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Created new 'Page List' view feature
- User requested table view similar to model feature catalog showing all pages (forms and reports)
- Solution: Created complete page list implementation with sorting, filtering, and action buttons
- Files created:
  - src/commands/pageListCommands.ts (command registration and data loading from ModelService)
  - src/webviews/pageListView.js (JavaScript webview with table, sorting, filtering)
- Files modified:
  - package.json (added appdna.pageList command and table icon menu item for PAGES tree item)
- Architecture: Uses ModelService.getAllObjects() to extract forms/reports where isPage='true', provides preview and details buttons
- Tree integration: PAGES item already had 'showPageList' context value, table icon now appears on PAGES tree item 
  * Report templates (14+ files): All columnTableTemplate, parameterTableTemplate, etc.
  * Object templates (7+ files): All propertiesTableTemplate, settingsTemplate, lookupItemsTemplate, etc.
  * Form templates (9+ files): All settingsTabTemplate, paramsTableTemplate, modalTemplates, buttonsTableTemplate, etc.
  * Script files: parameterManagementFunctions.js
- Pattern used: schema.enum.slice().sort().map() instead of schema.enum.map()
- Total enum patterns fixed: 25+ locations across webview templates
- Verification: Final grep search confirmed no remaining unsorted enum patterns

2025-08-02: review the page preview view report grid preview.  There is a scrollbar at the bottom under the paging and export controls. it shoudl be between the table and paging controls
COMPLETED: Fixed report grid scrollbar positioning in page preview
- Issue: Horizontal scrollbar appeared below both pagination controls and export buttons
- Solution: Restructured HTML to separate scrollable table area from pagination/export controls
- Added report-grid-wrapper as outer container with borders
- report-grid-container now contains only the scrollable table with overflow-x: auto
- Pagination controls positioned after scrollable area, export buttons after pagination
- Updated CSS to remove redundant borders since wrapper handles borders
- Result: Horizontal scrollbar now correctly positioned between table and pagination controls
- File modified: src/webviews/pagepreview/components/htmlGenerator.js

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Page List View UI improvements
- User requested three changes to page list view:
  1. ✅ Refresh icon button already implemented correctly (matches model feature catalog pattern)
  2. ✅ Removed 'Apply Filters' button - filters now work immediately on change (real-time filtering with 300ms debounce)
  3. ✅ Removed 'List' report type from dropdown and data processing logic (does not exist)
- Solution: Modified HTML template to remove apply filters button while keeping clear filters button, updated report type dropdown options, removed 'list' visualization type mapping
- CORRECTION: Added back 'Clear All' button after user pointed out it was needed to reset filter fields
- Files modified: 
  - src/commands/pageListCommands.ts (HTML template and data processing logic)
- Architecture: Filters already had real-time functionality with debounced input events, just removed manual apply button
- Result: Cleaner UI with immediate filter feedback, clear all functionality preserved, accurate report type options
