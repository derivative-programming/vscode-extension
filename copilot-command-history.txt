2025-08-02: for a report grid view filter of datetime i see a dropdown
2025-08-02: check the display of report grid filters too
2025-08-02: review the page preview details view. on a form preview make sure a control of data type 'datetime' shows a date picker and time picker. on date type 'date' its just a date picker
2025-08-02: on sql server data type properties we show a dropdown on many views. The items in this dropdown should be in alpha order
2025-08-02: i see data object details view props tab prop setting Sql Server DB Data Type: dropdown as unsorted
2025-08-02: its the data object details view properties tab list view
2025-08-02: COMPLETED: Fixed all dropdown sorting across entire extension
- User request expanded from SQL Server data type dropdowns to "all tabs of the form details view as well" and "all dropdowns, not just sql server data type"
- Solution: Applied consistent pattern of .slice().sort() before .map() to alphabetically sort all enum-based dropdowns
- Files modified: 

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Created new 'Page List' view feature
- User requested table view similar to model feature catalog showing all pages (forms and reports)
- Solution: Created complete page list implementation with sorting, filtering, and action buttons
- Files created:
  - src/commands/pageListCommands.ts (command registration and data loading from ModelService)
  - src/webviews/pageListView.js (JavaScript webview with table, sorting, filtering)
- Files modified:
  - package.json (added appdna.pageList command and table icon menu item for PAGES tree item)
- Architecture: Uses ModelService.getAllObjects() to extract forms/reports where isPage='true', provides preview and details buttons
- Tree integration: PAGES item already had 'showPageList' context value, table icon now appears on PAGES tree item 
  * Report templates (14+ files): All columnTableTemplate, parameterTableTemplate, etc.
  * Object templates (7+ files): All propertiesTableTemplate, settingsTemplate, lookupItemsTemplate, etc.
  * Form templates (9+ files): All settingsTabTemplate, paramsTableTemplate, modalTemplates, buttonsTableTemplate, etc.
  * Script files: parameterManagementFunctions.js
- Pattern used: schema.enum.slice().sort().map() instead of schema.enum.map()
- Total enum patterns fixed: 25+ locations across webview templates
- Verification: Final grep search confirmed no remaining unsorted enum patterns

2025-08-02: review the page preview view report grid preview.  There is a scrollbar at the bottom under the paging and export controls. it shoudl be between the table and paging controls
COMPLETED: Fixed report grid scrollbar positioning in page preview
- Issue: Horizontal scrollbar appeared below both pagination controls and export buttons
- Solution: Restructured HTML to separate scrollable table area from pagination/export controls
- Added report-grid-wrapper as outer container with borders
- report-grid-container now contains only the scrollable table with overflow-x: auto
- Pagination controls positioned after scrollable area, export buttons after pagination
- Updated CSS to remove redundant borders since wrapper handles borders
- Result: Horizontal scrollbar now correctly positioned between table and pagination controls
- File modified: src/webviews/pagepreview/components/htmlGenerator.js
