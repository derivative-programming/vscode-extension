2025-08-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Implement "Subscribe to Target Child Data Object Properties" checkbox in form input controls tab
- Added second subscription checkbox below owner subscription checkbox in input controls tab of form details view
- Checkbox controls target child object's propSubscription entries with destinationContextObjectName=TargetChildObjectName, destinationTargetName=FormName
- When checked: sets isIgnored="false" (or creates new entry if none exists)
- When unchecked: sets isIgnored="true" (creates entry if needed)
- Checkbox is automatically disabled when no targetChildObject is set on the form
- Added ModelService.getFormTargetChildObject() method to find target child object by form's targetChildObject property
- Added JavaScript handlers: initializeTargetChildSubscriptionCheckbox(), handleTargetChildSubscriptionToggle(), updateTargetChildSubscription()
- Added backend functions: getFormTargetChildSubscriptionState() and updateFormTargetChildSubscription()
- Added message handlers: getFormTargetChildSubscriptionState, updateFormTargetChildSubscription, setFormTargetChildSubscriptionState
- Uses same CSS styling as existing subscription controls (existing .subscription-controls styling)
- Checkbox state automatically initialized on tab load by querying current target child propSubscription
- Properly handles edge cases: missing target child object, missing propSubscription array, etc.
- Full integration with existing undo/save workflow via modelService.markUnsavedChanges()
Architecture Notes:
- Uses target child object's propSubscription array (not form's or owner's) per specification
- Maintains existing subscription entries and only modifies isIgnored flag
- Checkbox disabled state communicated via setFormTargetChildSubscriptionState message with isDisabled flag
- Business logic: isIgnored property missing = false (subscribed), isIgnored=true = unsubscribed
- Same pattern as reports but adapted for forms (objectWorkflow with isPage=true)

2025-08-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Implement "Subscribe to Target Child Data Object Properties" checkbox in report columns tab
- Added second subscription checkbox below owner subscription checkbox in columns tab
- Checkbox controls target child object's propSubscription entries with destinationContextObjectName=TargetChildObjectName, destinationTargetName=ReportName
- When checked: sets isIgnored="false" (or creates new entry if none exists)
- When unchecked: sets isIgnored="true" (creates entry if needed)
- Checkbox is automatically disabled when no targetChildObject is set on the report
- Added ModelService.getReportTargetChildObject() method to find target child object by report's targetChildObject property
- Added JavaScript handlers: initializeTargetChildSubscriptionCheckbox(), handleTargetChildSubscriptionToggle()
- Added backend functions: getTargetChildSubscriptionState() and updateTargetChildSubscription()
- Added message handlers: getTargetChildSubscriptionState, updateTargetChildSubscription, setTargetChildSubscriptionState
- Uses same CSS styling as owner subscription (existing .subscription-controls styling)
- Checkbox state automatically initialized on tab load by querying current target child propSubscription
- Properly handles edge cases: missing target child object, missing propSubscription array, etc.
- Full integration with existing undo/save workflow via modelService.markUnsavedChanges()
Architecture Notes:
- Uses target child object's propSubscription array (not report's or owner's) per specification
- Maintains existing subscription entries and only modifies isIgnored flag
- Checkbox disabled state communicated via setTargetChildSubscriptionState message with isDisabled flag
- Business logic: isIgnored property missing = false (subscribed), isIgnored=true = unsubscribed

2025-08-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Implement "Subscribe to Owner Data Object Properties" checkbox in report columns tab
- Added checkbox in columns tab list view after list buttons 
- Checkbox controls propSubscription entries with destinationContextObjectName=ObjectName, destinationTargetName=ReportName
- When checked: sets isIgnored="false" (or creates new entry if none exists)
- When unchecked: sets isIgnored="true" (creates entry if needed)
- Added CSS styling for .subscription-controls container with VS Code theming
- Added JavaScript handlers for checkbox toggle and state initialization
- Added backend functions: getOwnerSubscriptionState() and updateOwnerSubscription()
- Added message handlers: getOwnerSubscriptionState, updateOwnerSubscription, setOwnerSubscriptionState
- Uses ModelService.getReportOwnerObject() to find parent object for propSubscription management

2025-08-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Extend "Subscribe to Owner Data Object Properties" checkbox to form input controls tab
- Added identical subscription checkbox to form details view input controls tab
- Modified mainTemplate.js (forms) to include subscription controls div after list buttons
- Added subscription functionality to parameterManagementFunctions.js with same API as reports
- Added initializeOwnerSubscriptionCheckbox(), handleOwnerSubscriptionToggle(), getOwnerSubscriptionState(), updateOwnerSubscription() 
- Added message handler "updateFormOwnerSubscription" to formDetailsView.js backend
- Added updateFormOwnerSubscription() function using ModelService.getFormOwnerObject()
- Added subscription control CSS styling to forms/styles/detailsViewStyles.js
- Form subscription uses destinationContextObjectName='OwnerDataObject', destinationTargetName='Properties'
- Business logic: isIgnored property missing = false (subscribed), isIgnored=true = unsubscribed
- Architecture: Same pattern as reports - checkbox position, styling, backend integration, propSubscription array management
- Properly handles edge cases: missing propSubscription array, missing owner object, etc.
Architecture Notes:
- Checkbox state automatically initialized on tab load by querying current propSubscription
- Uses owner object's propSubscription array (not report's) per specification
- Maintains existing subscription entries and only modifies isIgnored flag
- Full integration with existing undo/save workflow via modelService.markUnsavedChanges()

2025-08-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Implement comprehensive ModelService getter methods
- Added getReport(reportName) - finds specific report by name
- Added getForm(formName) - finds specific form (objectWorkflow with isPage=true) by name  
- Added getPage(pageName) - finds either report or form page by name
- Added getObject(objectName) - finds specific object by name
- Added getReportOwnerObject(reportName) - finds object that owns a specific report
- Added getFormOwnerObject(formName) - finds object that owns a specific form
- Added getPageOwnerObject(pageName) - finds object that owns a specific page (report or form)
- Added getAllPages() - returns all pages (reports with isPage=true + all forms)
- Existing methods: getAllObjects(), getAllReports(), getAllForms()
Architecture Notes: 
- All methods use case-insensitive name matching with trim()
- Owner methods iterate through objects to find containing arrays
- Page methods handle both report and form types
- Null safety with proper fallbacks
- Maintains singleton pattern and existing caching behavior
