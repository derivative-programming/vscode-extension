The modal will have an 'Add' and cancel button. On click of Add, it will create a report column similar to this..."
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * Implemented complete "Add Destination Button Column" feature in report details view columns tab
  * Added button immediately left of existing "Add Column" button
  * Modal implementation:
    - Created addDestinationButtonColumnModalTemplate.js with destination page input, browse button, button text field, auto-generated column name
    - Created addDestinationButtonColumnModalFunctionality.js with auto-generation logic and validation
    - Integrated with existing page search modal functionality
    - Added click handler in columnManagementFunctions.js
    - Updated mainTemplate.js and clientScriptTemplate.js to include new modal
  * Backend implementation:
    - Added "addDestinationButtonColumn" case to message handler switch statement in reportDetailsView.js
    - Created addDestinationButtonColumnToReport() function with proper column structure generation
    - Implemented sourceObjectName logic using target child object or report owner fallback
    - Added destinationContextObjectName resolution using page owner object lookup
  * Generated column structure matches TODO example: name, buttonText, destinationContextObjectName, destinationTargetName, isButton="true", sourceObjectName, sourcePropertyName="Code", sqlServerDBDataType="nvarchar(50)"
  * Integration: Uses existing patterns for modal creation, message handling, and UI refresh

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Fix FK Object Name browse button not enabled when checkbox is manually checked
- Command: "if a check a checkbox i then cannot click browse button"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED 
- Architecture Notes:
  * Root Cause: Checkbox change event handler in parameterManagementFunctions.js was missing fKObjectName browse button logic
  * Problem: When user manually checks fKObjectName checkbox, no event handler was enabling the browse button
  * Solution: Added fKObjectName browse button state management to checkbox change event handler (lines 140-147)
  * Pattern: Each field with browse button needs logic in both:
    - Initial parameter selection handler (for when property already exists)
    - Checkbox change event handler (for when user manually checks/unchecks)
- Code Added: Browse button enable/disable logic in checkbox.addEventListener('change') for fKObjectName field
- Build Status: Compiled successfully with webpack
- Testing: Checkbox check → browse button enabled, checkbox uncheck → browse button disabled

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Fix FK Object Name browse button disabled state
- Command: "the browse button is now visible, but its disabled"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED 
- Architecture Notes:
  * Root Cause: parameterManagementFunctions.js had logic to set browse button state for sourceObjectName but missing for fKObjectName
  * Solution: Added browse button state initialization for fKObjectName field in parameter selection handler
  * Code Added: Browse button state logic in parameterManagementFunctions.js lines 75-81
  * Pattern: When parameter is selected, checkbox state determines browse button enabled/disabled state
  * Logic Flow: param selected → property exists check → checkbox checked → browse button enabled
- Build Status: Compiled successfully with webpack
- Next Steps: Refresh Form Details webview to test browse button functionality

2025-08-17: ✅ COMPLETED - Fix FK Object Name browse button not visible due to case sensitivity issue
- Command: "Form details view: Input controls tab: 'fk object name' setting: 'browse data objects' button its not visible"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * Root Cause: Code was checking for "fkObjectName" (lowercase k) but schema uses "fKObjectName" (capital K)
  * Fixed case sensitivity issue in 5 files:
    - paramsListTemplate.js: Updated propKey comparison to "fKObjectName"
    - paramsTableTemplate.js: Updated paramKey comparison to "fKObjectName" 
    - domInitialization.js: Updated propKey comparison to "fKObjectName"
    - formControlUtilities.js: Updated propertyName comparison to "fKObjectName" (both enable/disable cases)
    - uiEventHandlers.js: Updated propertyName comparison to "fKObjectName"
  * Browse button should now appear for FK Object Name field when property checkbox is checked
- Pattern: Case-sensitive property name matching - schema property names must match exactly in JavaScript comparisons
- Build Status: Compiled successfully with webpack

2025-01-25: ✅ COMPLETED - Fix destinationContextObjectName not being set for button creation
- Command: "destinationContextObjectName is not being set"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * Fixed issue where destinationContextObjectName and destinationTargetName were not initialized for regular buttons
  * Added empty string initialization for these fields in addButtonToReport() and addButtonToReportWithName() functions
  * Added empty string initialization for form buttons in addButtonToFormWithText() function
  * Enhanced debugging for addBreadcrumbToReport() to help diagnose when getPageOwnerObject() returns null
  * Root cause: Regular buttons need these fields available in UI for user to populate when creating navigation buttons
  * For breadcrumb buttons: destinationContextObjectName is automatically populated via getPageOwnerObject()
  * For regular buttons: destinationContextObjectName and destinationTargetName start as empty strings for user to fill
  * This ensures all button types have consistent field structure matching the schema
- Files Modified:
  * src/webviews/reports/reportDetailsView.js - Added field initialization and enhanced debugging
  * src/webviews/forms/formDetailsView.js - Added field initialization for form buttons
- Testing: Code compiles successfully, all button creation functions now properly initialize navigation fields

2025-01-25: ✅ COMPLETED - Add isVisible, isEnabled, and isButtonCallToAction properties to report button creation functions
- Command: "review the report details view buttons tab 'add breadcrumb' button. add these items too... isVisible: "true", isEnabled: "true", isButtonCallToAction: "false""
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture Notes:
  * Updated addBreadcrumbToReport() function to include the three new properties when creating breadcrumb buttons
  * Updated addButtonToReport() function to include the three new properties when creating default buttons  
  * Updated addButtonToReportWithName() function to include the three new properties when creating named buttons
  * Updated addButtonToFormWithText() function in formDetailsView.js to include isVisible and isButtonCallToAction (isEnabled not available for form buttons per schema)
  * All properties set to default values: isVisible="true", isEnabled="true" (reports only), isButtonCallToAction="false"
  * Properties are defined in app-dna.schema.json for reportButton and objectWorkflowButton items as string enums with "true"/"false" values
  * Ensures consistent button creation with proper default visibility, enabled state, and call-to-action styling across both reports and forms
- Files Modified:
  * src/webviews/reports/reportDetailsView.js - Updated all three button creation functions to include new properties
  * src/webviews/forms/formDetailsView.js - Updated addButtonToFormWithText() function to include available properties
- Testing: Code compiles successfully, maintains existing functionality while adding proper default property values

2025-01-25: ✅ COMPLETED - Hide 'Is Exposed In Business Object' setting in form details view settings tab
- Added "isexposedinbusinessobject" to getFormPropertiesToIgnore() function in settingsTabTemplate.js
- Property isExposedInBusinessObject (schema description: "Defines access to business logic functionality") no longer appears in form settings tab
- Minimal change: Added 1 line to existing property filtering list following established pattern
- Build and lint verification: All tests pass, no new warnings introduced
- Architecture: Consistent with existing property hiding patterns used in reports and objects settings tabs

2025-01-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Form details view: input controls tab: missing the fkObjectName setting (Issue #227)
- Command: "Form details view: input controls tab: missing the fkObjectName setting"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture: Implemented complete fkObjectName field visibility and browse functionality for Forms webview input controls tab
- Components Modified:
  * Updated paramsListTemplate.js to remove "fkobjectname" from getParamPropertiesToHide() function

  * Updated formControlUtilities.js to manage browse button state (enable/disable) when fkObjectName property checkbox is toggled
  * Updated uiEventHandlers.js to set initial browse button state for fkObjectName field during page initialization
- Pattern: Followed exact same implementation pattern as existing sourceObjectName field implementation
- Data Integration: Reuses existing allDataObjects data and createDataObjectSearchModal functionality
- Button Management: Browse button state properly synchronized with property existence checkbox
- Modal Functionality: Uses existing dataObjectSearchModalTemplate.js and dataObjectSearchModalFunctionality.js with text filter
- Result: Users can now see and configure fkObjectName field in Forms webview input controls tab, with browse data objects functionality

- Result: Users can now see and configure sourceObjectName field in Reports webview columns tab, with browse data objects functionality
- Status: Compiled successfully, ready for testing
- Command: "Page preview view: Form preview: Lookup dropdown item list update"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture: Enhanced page preview form generation to show actual lookup items instead of sample data
- Issue: When IsFKList=true, page preview showed hardcoded "Sample Option 1/2" instead of actual lookup items from fkObjectName data object
- Solution Implemented:
  * Added getLookupItemsForFKObject() helper function to extract lookup items from FK data objects
  * Modified generateFormInput() to use actual lookup data from allObjects when IsFKList=true
  * Updated generateFilterInput() for report filters to use same lookup data logic
  * Added proper handling for both fKObjectName and fkObjectName property variations
  * Implemented filtering to show only active lookup items (isActive="true")
  * Added fallback messages when FK object not found or has no lookup items
  * Enhanced debug logging to help troubleshoot FK dropdown generation
- Data Flow: allObjects → getLookupItemsForFKObject(fkObjectName) → dropdown options (name, displayName, description)
- Lookup Item Properties Used:
  * name: option value
  * displayName: visible text (fallback to name if not set)
  * description: tooltip text
  * isActive: filter out inactive items
- Edge Cases Handled:
  * FK object name not found: shows "No items found in [objectName]"
  * FK object has no lookup items: shows informative message
  * Missing fkObjectName: graceful degradation
- Components Modified:
  * src/webviews/pagepreview/components/htmlGenerator.js - main implementation
- Result: FK dropdown controls now show real lookup data instead of sample data
- Status: Compiled successfully, enhanced with debug logging for troubleshooting

2025-01-16: ✅ FIXED - Lookup Button Hover Styling
- Problem: Lookup button showed dark blue background on hover (using vscode-button-hoverBackground)
- Solution: Removed background color change on hover, replaced with subtle border color change
- Updated: .control-with-button .lookup-button:hover to use border-color: var(--vscode-focusBorder)
- Result: More subtle hover effect without dark blue background
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

2025-01-16: ✅ FIXED - Destination Target Name Control Width Consistency
- Problem: destinationTargetName field with browse button was narrower than other setting controls
- Root Cause: .control-with-button container didn't have flex: 1 in form-row context
- Solution: Added .form-row .control-with-button to CSS flex styling rules
- Result: destinationTargetName control now matches width of other form controls
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

2025-01-16: ✅ FIXED - Button Settings Control Width Issue
- Problem: All button setting controls were wrapped in .control-with-button container, affecting width
- Root Cause: List template was applying .control-with-button to all fields, not just destinationTargetName
- Solution: Modified buttonsListTemplate.js to conditionally apply .control-with-button only when browse button exists
- Added: Proper flex styling for form-row input fields (flex: 1, min-width: 0)
- Result: Setting controls return to normal width, browse buttons only appear for destinationTargetName
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

2025-01-16: ✅ COMPLETED - "Browse for Page" Modal Implementation for destinationTargetName Field

2025-08-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Implement "Subscribe to Target Child Data Object Properties" checkbox in form input controls tab
- Added second subscription checkbox below owner subscription checkbox in input controls tab of form details view
- Checkbox controls target child object's propSubscription entries with destinationContextObjectName=TargetChildObjectName, destinationTargetName=FormName
- When checked: sets isIgnored="false" (or creates new entry if none exists)
- When unchecked: sets isIgnored="true" (creates entry if needed)
- Checkbox is automatically disabled when no targetChildObject is set on the form
- Added ModelService.getFormTargetChildObject() method to find target child object by form's targetChildObject property
- Added JavaScript handlers: initializeTargetChildSubscriptionCheckbox(), handleTargetChildSubscriptionToggle(), updateTargetChildSubscription()
- Added backend functions: getFormTargetChildSubscriptionState() and updateFormTargetChildSubscription()
- Added message handlers: getFormTargetChildSubscriptionState, updateFormTargetChildSubscription, setFormTargetChildSubscriptionState
- Uses same CSS styling as existing subscription controls (existing .subscription-controls styling)
- Checkbox state automatically initialized on tab load by querying current target child propSubscription
- Properly handles edge cases: missing target child object, missing propSubscription array, etc.

2025-01-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed missing command registration error
- Command: "review the form details view owner data object display edit button. getting error command 'appdna.showObjectDetails' not found"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Problem: Form details view was calling 'appdna.showObjectDetails' command but only 'appdna.showDetails' command was registered
- Root Cause: Incorrect command name used in formDetailsView.js line 481
- Solution: Updated formDetailsView.js to use correct command name 'appdna.showDetails' instead of 'appdna.showObjectDetails'
- Architecture: Command registration in registerCommands.ts uses 'appdna.showDetails' and calls objectDetailsView.showObjectDetails function
- Result: Owner data object edit button will now work correctly without command not found error
- Status: Fixed - command name corrected

2025-08-16: ✅ FIXED - Reports Webview Browse Button Inactive Issue
- Problem: Browse button for 'Destination Target Name' was inactive/disabled in Reports webview

- Solution: Added browse button click event handling to domInitialization.js:
  * Added setupPageBrowseButtonHandlers() function with event delegation for .lookup-button clicks
  * Added call to setupPageBrowseButtonHandlers() in DOM initialization
  * Event handler finds input field using data-field-id attribute and calls createPageSearchModal()
  * Handles both list view and table view browse button clicks
- Pattern: Copied exact same click handling logic from Forms webview for consistency
- Integration: Click events now properly trigger the page search modal functionality
- Result: Browse button clicks now open the "Browse for Page" modal as expected

    - Added browse button state management in checkbox change handler (list view) 
    - Added browse button state management in table checkbox handlers (both checked/unchecked)
  * Existing domInitialization.js setupPageBrowseButtonHandlers() already handles column browse buttons
- Pattern: Reused same browse button implementation from buttons tab for consistency
- Integration: Browse button state properly synchronized with property existence checkboxes in both list and table views
- Result: Report columns tab now has same "Browse for Page" functionality as buttons tab for destinationTargetName field
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

2025-08-16: ✅ FIXED - Browse Button Modal Changes Not Setting 'Unsaved Changes' Flag
- Problem: Changes made using browse button and modal did not trigger the 'unsaved changes' flag
- Root Cause: Column management functions only listened for 'input' events, but modal dispatches 'change' events
- Solution: Added 'change' event listeners to column input fields in columnManagementFunctions.js:
  * Added field.addEventListener('change', updateInputHandler) for column list view inputs
  * Change events now trigger the same update logic as input events
  * Both 'input' and 'change' events now properly update the model and mark unsaved changes
- Analysis: Button management functions already had both 'input' and 'change' listeners, so they worked correctly
- Backend: updateButtonDirectly() and updateColumnDirectly() both call modelService.markUnsavedChanges()
- Result: Browse button modal changes now properly trigger the 'unsaved changes' flag for both buttons and columns
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

2025-01-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Text Filter Implementation for Page Search Modal

Date: 2025-08-17
Command: Handle missing report.isPage as true

STATUS: COMPLETED

Changes Made:
1. Made ModelService.isPageReport() method public to allow external access
2. Updated ModelService.getAllPages() to use isPageReport() helper instead of direct comparison
3. Updated ModelService.getPageOwnerObject() to use isPageReport() helper instead of direct comparison
4. Updated userStoriesJourneyCommands.ts to use modelService.isPageReport() instead of report.isPage === "true"
5. Updated userStoriesPageMappingCommands.ts (3 locations) to use modelService.isPageReport() instead of report.isPage === "true"

Architecture Notes:
- The isPageReport() helper function already existed in ModelService and correctly handles the logic: report.isPage === "true" || report.isPage === undefined
- Making it public allows other command files to use the same centralized logic
- All report.isPage checks now consistently treat missing isPage as true across the codebase
- Workflow.isPage checks were left unchanged per user request to focus only on reports

Files Modified:
- src/services/modelService.ts
- src/commands/userStoriesJourneyCommands.ts  
- src/commands/userStoriesPageMappingCommands.ts

The changes ensure that throughout the codebase, missing report.isPage properties are consistently treated as if the value is 'true', providing a better default behavior for reports that don't explicitly set this property.
