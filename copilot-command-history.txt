2024-12-31 XX:XX:XX - MODEL CHANGE REQUEST LIST VIEW - CSV EXPORT
USER REQUEST: "Review the data object list view and its 'download csv' icon button. Review the model change request list view. We want to add a similar 'download csv' button there."
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made**:
1. Modified `changeRequestsListView.ts`:
   - Added export button to HTML template in action-controls section
   - Added 'exportToCSV' message handler that calls `saveChangeRequestsToCSV()`
   - Added 'saveCsvToWorkspace' message handler to save and open CSV file
   - Added `saveChangeRequestsToCSV()` function that generates CSV with headers: Code, Description, Property Name, Old Value, New Value, Status, Rejection Reason

2. Modified `changeRequestsListView.js`:
   - Added event listener for export button click
   - Added `exportToCSV()` function that sends 'exportToCSV' message to extension
   - Added 'csvExportReady' message handler that forwards to 'saveCsvToWorkspace'

**Technical Details**:
- CSV export flow: webview 'exportToCSV' → extension generates CSV → 'csvExportReady' → webview sends 'saveCsvToWorkspace' → extension saves and opens file
- Uses same pattern as dataObjectListView.js for consistency
- CSV filename includes request code and timestamp: `change-requests-{requestCode}-{timestamp}.csv`
- All CSV values are properly quoted and escaped for proper parsing
- File opens automatically in VS Code after successful save
- Export button styled consistent with refresh/validate buttons

**Architecture Notes**:
- Maintains consistent UX across all CSV export functionality
- Follows existing message-passing patterns between webview and extension
- All change request fields included in export for comprehensive data access
