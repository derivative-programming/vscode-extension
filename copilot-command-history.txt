2025-01-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Page preview view: Form preview: Lookup dropdown item list update (Issue #226)
- Command: "Page preview view: Form preview: Lookup dropdown item list update"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture: Implemented dynamic lookup dropdown population for form preview when IsFKList=true
- Components Modified:
  * Updated htmlGenerator.js in pagepreview components:
    - Added getLookupItems() helper function to retrieve lookup items from fkObjectName data object
    - Enhanced generateFormInput() function to use actual lookup items instead of static samples
    - Updated generateFilterInput() function for consistency in report filters
    - Filters only active lookup items (isActive="true" or undefined)
    - Uses displayName for option text, name for option value
    - Maintains backward compatibility with fallback to sample options
- Implementation Details:
  * Searches through allObjects to find lookup data object by fkObjectName
  * Only includes active lookup items in dropdown (isActive property filtering)
  * Uses displayName as option display text, falls back to name if not available
  * Uses name property as option value for form submissions
  * Graceful fallback to "Sample Option 1/2" if lookup data not found
  * Applied same enhancement to both form inputs and report filter inputs
- Testing: Created comprehensive test case with StatusLookup object containing multiple lookup items
- Verification: Screenshot demonstrates dropdown showing actual lookup items ("Active Status", "Inactive Status", "Pending Status") instead of static samples
- Pattern: Follows existing extension patterns for data retrieval and HTML generation
- Result: Form preview dropdowns now display real lookup data when fkObjectName is specified
- Status: Compiled successfully, production-ready code

2025-01-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Form details view: input controls tab: missing the fkObjectName setting (Issue #227)
- Command: "Form details view: input controls tab: missing the fkObjectName setting"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Architecture: Implemented complete fkObjectName field visibility and browse functionality for Forms webview input controls tab
- Components Modified:
  * Updated paramsListTemplate.js to remove "fkobjectname" from getParamPropertiesToHide() function
  * Added browse button for fkObjectName field with same pattern as sourceObjectName
  * Updated paramsTableTemplate.js to remove "fkobjectname" from hidden properties and add browse button
  * Updated domInitialization.js to handle fkObjectName browse button clicks via createDataObjectSearchModal
  * Updated formControlUtilities.js to manage browse button state (enable/disable) when fkObjectName property checkbox is toggled
  * Updated uiEventHandlers.js to set initial browse button state for fkObjectName field during page initialization
- Pattern: Followed exact same implementation pattern as existing sourceObjectName field implementation
- Data Integration: Reuses existing allDataObjects data and createDataObjectSearchModal functionality
- Button Management: Browse button state properly synchronized with property existence checkbox
- Modal Functionality: Uses existing dataObjectSearchModalTemplate.js and dataObjectSearchModalFunctionality.js with text filter
- Result: Users can now see and configure fkObjectName field in Forms webview input controls tab, with browse data objects functionality
- Status: Compiled successfully, ready for testing

2025-01-16: ✅ FIXED - Lookup Button Hover Styling
- Problem: Lookup button showed dark blue background on hover (using vscode-button-hoverBackground)
- Solution: Removed background color change on hover, replaced with subtle border color change
- Updated: .control-with-button .lookup-button:hover to use border-color: var(--vscode-focusBorder)
- Result: More subtle hover effect without dark blue background
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

2025-01-16: ✅ FIXED - Destination Target Name Control Width Consistency
- Problem: destinationTargetName field with browse button was narrower than other setting controls
- Root Cause: .control-with-button container didn't have flex: 1 in form-row context
- Solution: Added .form-row .control-with-button to CSS flex styling rules
- Result: destinationTargetName control now matches width of other form controls
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

2025-01-16: ✅ FIXED - Button Settings Control Width Issue
- Problem: All button setting controls were wrapped in .control-with-button container, affecting width
- Root Cause: List template was applying .control-with-button to all fields, not just destinationTargetName
- Solution: Modified buttonsListTemplate.js to conditionally apply .control-with-button only when browse button exists
- Added: Proper flex styling for form-row input fields (flex: 1, min-width: 0)
- Result: Setting controls return to normal width, browse buttons only appear for destinationTargetName
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

2025-01-16: ✅ COMPLETED - "Browse for Page" Modal Implementation for destinationTargetName Field
- Created pageSearchModalTemplate.js with filter dropdown (Forms/Reports) and page list selection

- Status: 100% complete - all components compile successfully in webpack
- Architecture: Follows same pattern as FK object browser modal for consistency

2025-08-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Implement "Subscribe to Target Child Data Object Properties" checkbox in form input controls tab
- Added second subscription checkbox below owner subscription checkbox in input controls tab of form details view
- Checkbox controls target child object's propSubscription entries with destinationContextObjectName=TargetChildObjectName, destinationTargetName=FormName
- When checked: sets isIgnored="false" (or creates new entry if none exists)
- When unchecked: sets isIgnored="true" (creates entry if needed)
- Checkbox is automatically disabled when no targetChildObject is set on the form
- Added ModelService.getFormTargetChildObject() method to find target child object by form's targetChildObject property
- Added JavaScript handlers: initializeTargetChildSubscriptionCheckbox(), handleTargetChildSubscriptionToggle(), updateTargetChildSubscription()
- Added backend functions: getFormTargetChildSubscriptionState() and updateFormTargetChildSubscription()
- Added message handlers: getFormTargetChildSubscriptionState, updateFormTargetChildSubscription, setFormTargetChildSubscriptionState
- Uses same CSS styling as existing subscription controls (existing .subscription-controls styling)
- Checkbox state automatically initialized on tab load by querying current target child propSubscription
- Properly handles edge cases: missing target child object, missing propSubscription array, etc.
- Full integration with existing undo/save workflow via modelService.markUnsavedChanges()
Architecture Notes:
- Uses target child object's propSubscription array (not form's or owner's) per specification
- Maintains existing subscription entries and only modifies isIgnored flag
- Checkbox disabled state communicated via setFormTargetChildSubscriptionState message with isDisabled flag
- Business logic: isIgnored property missing = false (subscribed), isIgnored=true = unsubscribed
- Same pattern as reports but adapted for forms (objectWorkflow with isPage=true)

2025-08-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Implement "Subscribe to Target Child Data Object Properties" checkbox in report columns tab
- Added second subscription checkbox below owner subscription checkbox in columns tab
- Checkbox controls target child object's propSubscription entries with destinationContextObjectName=TargetChildObjectName, destinationTargetName=ReportName

- Added checkbox in columns tab list view after list buttons 
- Checkbox controls propSubscription entries with destinationContextObjectName=ObjectName, destinationTargetName=ReportName
- When checked: sets isIgnored="false" (or creates new entry if none exists)
- When unchecked: sets isIgnored="true" (creates entry if needed)
- Added CSS styling for .subscription-controls container with VS Code theming
- Added JavaScript handlers for checkbox toggle and state initialization
- Added backend functions: getOwnerSubscriptionState() and updateOwnerSubscription()
- Added message handlers: getOwnerSubscriptionState, updateOwnerSubscription, setOwnerSubscriptionState
- Uses ModelService.getReportOwnerObject() to find parent object for propSubscription management

2025-08-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Extend "Subscribe to Owner Data Object Properties" checkbox to form input controls tab
- Added identical subscription checkbox to form details view input controls tab
- Modified mainTemplate.js (forms) to include subscription controls div after list buttons
- Added subscription functionality to parameterManagementFunctions.js with same API as reports

- Properly handles edge cases: missing propSubscription array, missing owner object, etc.
Architecture Notes:
- Checkbox state automatically initialized on tab load by querying current propSubscription
- Uses owner object's propSubscription array (not report's) per specification
- Maintains existing subscription entries and only modifies isIgnored flag
- Full integration with existing undo/save workflow via modelService.markUnsavedChanges()

2025-08-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Implement comprehensive ModelService getter methods

2025-01-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed missing command registration error
- Command: "review the form details view owner data object display edit button. getting error command 'appdna.showObjectDetails' not found"
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Problem: Form details view was calling 'appdna.showObjectDetails' command but only 'appdna.showDetails' command was registered
- Root Cause: Incorrect command name used in formDetailsView.js line 481
- Solution: Updated formDetailsView.js to use correct command name 'appdna.showDetails' instead of 'appdna.showObjectDetails'
- Architecture: Command registration in registerCommands.ts uses 'appdna.showDetails' and calls objectDetailsView.showObjectDetails function
- Result: Owner data object edit button will now work correctly without command not found error
- Status: Fixed - command name corrected

2025-08-16: ✅ FIXED - Reports Webview Browse Button Inactive Issue
- Problem: Browse button for 'Destination Target Name' was inactive/disabled in Reports webview

  * Added browse button enable/disable logic in property existence handler (list view)
  * Added browse button state management in checkbox change handler (list view) 
  * Added browse button state management in table checkbox handlers (both checked/unchecked)
  * Browse button now enables when property checkbox is checked, disables when unchecked
- Pattern: Copied same browse button management logic from Forms webview for consistency
- Integration: Browse button state properly synchronized with property existence checkboxes
- Result: Browse button now activates correctly when destinationTargetName property exists
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

2025-08-16: ✅ FIXED - Reports Webview Browse Button Click Not Working
- Problem: Nothing happened when clicking the browse button in Reports webview
- Root Cause: Reports webview missing browse button click event handlers
- Solution: Added browse button click event handling to domInitialization.js:
  * Added setupPageBrowseButtonHandlers() function with event delegation for .lookup-button clicks
  * Added call to setupPageBrowseButtonHandlers() in DOM initialization
  * Event handler finds input field using data-field-id attribute and calls createPageSearchModal()
  * Handles both list view and table view browse button clicks
- Pattern: Copied exact same click handling logic from Forms webview for consistency
- Integration: Click events now properly trigger the page search modal functionality
- Result: Browse button clicks now open the "Browse for Page" modal as expected

    - Added browse button state management in checkbox change handler (list view) 
    - Added browse button state management in table checkbox handlers (both checked/unchecked)
  * Existing domInitialization.js setupPageBrowseButtonHandlers() already handles column browse buttons
- Pattern: Reused same browse button implementation from buttons tab for consistency
- Integration: Browse button state properly synchronized with property existence checkboxes in both list and table views
- Result: Report columns tab now has same "Browse for Page" functionality as buttons tab for destinationTargetName field
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully

2025-08-16: ✅ FIXED - Browse Button Modal Changes Not Setting 'Unsaved Changes' Flag
- Problem: Changes made using browse button and modal did not trigger the 'unsaved changes' flag
- Root Cause: Column management functions only listened for 'input' events, but modal dispatches 'change' events
- Solution: Added 'change' event listeners to column input fields in columnManagementFunctions.js:
  * Added field.addEventListener('change', updateInputHandler) for column list view inputs
  * Change events now trigger the same update logic as input events
  * Both 'input' and 'change' events now properly update the model and mark unsaved changes
- Analysis: Button management functions already had both 'input' and 'change' listeners, so they worked correctly
- Backend: updateButtonDirectly() and updateColumnDirectly() both call modelService.markUnsavedChanges()
- Result: Browse button modal changes now properly trigger the 'unsaved changes' flag for both buttons and columns
- Status: Fixed and compiled successfully
