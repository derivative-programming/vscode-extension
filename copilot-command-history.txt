2025-08-16: âœ… COMPLETED - Implement comprehensive ModelService getter methods
- Added getReport(reportName) - finds specific report by name
- Added getForm(formName) - finds specific form (objectWorkflow with isPage=true) by name  
- Added getPage(pageName) - finds either report or form page by name
- Added getObject(objectName) - finds specific object by name
- Added getReportOwnerObject(reportName) - finds object that owns a specific report
- Added getFormOwnerObject(formName) - finds object that owns a specific form
- Added getPageOwnerObject(pageName) - finds object that owns a specific page (report or form)
- Added getAllPages() - returns all pages (reports with isPage=true + all forms)
- Existing methods: getAllObjects(), getAllReports(), getAllForms()
Architecture Notes: 
- All methods use case-insensitive name matching with trim()
- Owner methods iterate through objects to find containing arrays
- Page methods handle both report and form types
- Null safety with proper fallbacks
- Maintains singleton pattern and existing caching behavior
