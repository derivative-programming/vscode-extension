2025-01-19:2025-01-19: Restructured page preview layout to properly separate page-level content from form content. Page header (pageTitleText, pageIntroText) now appears in main container above the form, while form-specific content (formTitleText, formIntroText) appears within the form container. This creates a clearer visual hierarchy matching typical page/form structure.
2025-01-19: Removed meta preview information ('Form Preview' and role display) from page header to create authentic page representation. The page preview now shows only actual page content (pageTitleText, pageIntroText) without preview-specific annotations, providing a cleaner simulation of the real page experience.
2025-01-19: Enhanced form preview with dynamic parameter-based form fields and clickable navigation buttons. Form fields are generated based on actual objectWorkflowParam data with proper input types (text, number, date, password, checkbox, dropdown, textarea) determined by SQL data types and properties. Form buttons are now clickable and navigate to their destination pages by updating the dropdown selection, implementing the todo requirement for button-based navigation.
2025-01-19: Fixed JavaScript error "handleRoleChange is not defined" in page preview by sanitizing page data before JSON.stringify. Added proper data cleaning for objectWorkflowParam to prevent serialization errors that were breaking the JavaScript execution and preventing dropdown population.
2025-01-19: Fixed critical HTML/JavaScript syntax error in page preview role filter generation. Role names with special characters (spaces, quotes, etc.) were breaking HTML id attributes and JavaScript function calls. Added proper role name escaping for HTML ids and data-role attributes, updated handleRoleChange function to use data attributes instead of parsing ids.Added plus icon button to Forms treeview item similar to Reports - created addForm command stub in package.json, formCommands.ts, and registerCommands.ts. Command shows placeholder message since form wizard is not implemented yet.
2025-01-19: Created complete Add Form Wizard (addFormWizardView.js) with 5-step process: 1) Owner object selection, 2) Role selection (with skip logic), 3) New instance question, 4a) Target object selection OR 4b) Action selection, 5) Form name/title. Updated formCommands.ts and modelService.ts to support form creation. Wizard creates form objects with proper structure including objectWorkflowButton array.
2025-01-19: Fixed role list population in Form Wizard step 2 - changed from using objectProperty to using lookupItem.displayName to match Report Wizard implementation.
2025-01-19: Fixed Form Wizard step 4b issues: 1) Step indicator now shows active for both step 4a and 4b by mapping to progress-step-4, 2) Back button navigation from step 4 variants properly handled to go to step 3.
2025-01-19: Changed Form Wizard Step 4b from dropdown to textbox for custom action input. Users can now enter custom actions in PascalCase format (e.g., Save, Delete, UpdateStatus). Action is optional with validation for PascalCase format when provided.
2025-01-19: Updated Form Wizard to default action to 'Add' when creating new data object instance - applies to both form name and form title generation in the final step.
2025-01-19: Removed cancel button from step 1 of Form Wizard - cleaned up HTML and event listener for cleaner step 1 interface.
2025-01-19: Updated form title generation to use format [Action] [OwnerObjectName] or [Action] [ChildObjectName] - action appears first, followed by the appropriate object name.

Updated HTML generation to show structured page header with title/intro, separate form header section, improved form field examples with textarea, and enhanced CSS styling for better visual hierarchy.
2025-01-19: Restructured page preview layout to properly separate page-level content from form content. Page header (pageTitleText, pageIntroText) now appears in main container above the form, while form-specific content (formTitleText, formIntroText) appears within the form container.

2025-01-19: Fixed Lookup Items tab event handling - added input event listeners with 300ms debouncing to match Properties and Settings tabs behavior.
