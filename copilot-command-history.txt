2025-01-20: Fixed broken image URLs in README.md by replacing GitHub blob URLs with raw GitHub URLs. Changed all image URLs from 'github.com/blob/main/' to 'raw.githubusercontent.com/main/' format which is required for proper image display on VS Code Marketplace. Updated MARKETPLACE-PUBLISHING-GUIDE.md to document the correct URL format and explain why blob URLs cause broken images.
2025-07-27: Added missing move button event handlers for Input Controls tab. Parameter management was missing event handlers for moveUpParamsButton and moveDownParamsButton, causing clicks to do nothing. Added event handlers that send moveParam commands with nested data structure {fromIndex, toIndex} to match server expectations. Parameters now properly move up/down when buttons are clicked.
2025-07-27: Fixed form details view move button states by implementing report-style button management. Updated client script template to include updateMoveButtonStates function, added selection preservation in refresh functions, and set up event listeners for list selection changes. Move buttons now properly disable when no item selected or when item can't move in that direction, matching report details view behavior.
2025-07-27: Fixed message data structure mismatch in form details view move functionality. Client-side code sends fromIndex/toIndex directly on message object for moveButton/moveOutputVar commands, but nested in data property for reorderForm* commands. Added proper data extraction for both patterns and added missing message handlers for reorderFormParam, reorderFormButton, and reorderFormOutputVar commands that parameter management functions actually send.
2025-07-27: Fixed form details view move up/down functionality to match report details view implementation. Updated moveParamInArray, moveButtonInArray, and moveOutputVarInArray functions to use fromIndex/toIndex pattern instead of direction-based moves, added panel parameter for webview refresh, replaced saveModel() with markUnsavedChanges(), added postMessage to refresh lists in webview, and improved error handling and validation. All move functions now consistently use the same robust pattern as report details view.
2025-07-26: Added hover effect to view preview button with !important declarations to match icon buttons on preview view
2025-07-26: Added eye icon button to report details view - includes header container layout, view preview button styling with hover effects, openPagePreview function in client script, context parameter support, codicons URI handling, and openPagePreview message handler for cross-view navigation to page preview
2025-07-26: Fixed extension context not available error for report details view by adding showReportDetailsCommand wrapper function that ensures context is properly passed from command registration scope
2025-07-26: Fixed extension context issue in page preview view - updated showReportDetailsForPreview to pass currentContext parameter when calling showReportDetails, matching the pattern already used for forms
2025-07-27: Analyzed form details view modals - documented 6 different modals available: param-modal (edit parameters), button-modal (edit buttons), output-var-modal (edit output variables), add-param-modal (add new parameters), add-button-modal (add new buttons), and add-output-var-modal (add new output variables). All modals follow consistent pattern with form fields generated from schema, property toggle checkboxes, save/cancel actions, and tooltip support for schema descriptions.
2025-07-27: Reviewed form details view list buttons - each tab (Input Controls, Buttons, Output Variables) has consistent set of 5 buttons: Add (specific to tab), Copy, Move Up, Move Down, and Reverse. All tabs use same pattern with select list + button group layout for managing array items.
2025-07-26: Fixed incorrect import paths for reportDetailsView module - corrected paths from '../webviews/reportDetailsView' to '../webviews/reports/reportDetailsView' in commands and updated wrapper function to pass context parameter through
2025-01-20: Fixed VS Code Marketplace screenshot display issue. Removed invalid 'screenshots' array from package.json (not supported by VS Code extensions) and properly added all 5 screenshots to README.md using markdown image syntax with GitHub URLs. Updated MARKETPLACE-PUBLISHING-GUIDE.md to correct the misinformation and add troubleshooting section explaining that VS Code Marketplace displays images from README.md, not package.json configuration.
2024-12-29: Fixed copy buttons across all views to copy list contents to clipboard. Converted report view copy buttons (columns, buttons, params) from object duplication to clipboard copy using navigator.clipboard API with fallback. Fixed all three form view copy buttons (buttons, output variables, parameters) to copy item names to clipboard instead of duplicating objects. This ensures consistent clipboard copy behavior across data object view, report view, and form view.

Fix 'context is not defined' error in form details view - Added context parameter to showFormDetails function chain, updated function signatures in formDetailsView.js, formCommands.ts, registerCommands.ts, pagePreviewView.js, and pageFlowDiagramView.js to properly pass extension context for codicon CSS loading

Fix page selection error and improve icon visibility - Fixed getPagePreviewPanel access pattern (panel.webview instead of result.webview), added enhanced debug logging for page preview communication, and added visible fallback icon and debugging CSS for view preview button visibility

2025-07-26: Removed placeholder content from form preview when no controls are defined

2025-07-27: Review the 'reverse' button on the three tabs in report details view

2025-07-27: Fixed reverse buttons in report details view not updating display - replaced excessive refreshAll() calls with lightweight targeted list updates. Now when reverse buttons are clicked, backend sends specific refresh messages (refreshColumnsList, refreshButtonsList, refreshParamsList) to webview which updates only the affected select list without regenerating entire view. More efficient approach that only updates what changed.

2025-07-27: Fixed reverse buttons in form details view not updating display - applied same lightweight approach as reports. Added panel parameter to reverse functions, fixed command name inconsistencies (added support for both reverseButton/reverseButtons), removed duplicate reverseParams handler, and added client-side refresh handlers (refreshParamsList, refreshButtonsList, refreshOutputVarsList). Now form reverse buttons update display immediately without heavy webview regeneration.

2025-07-27: Fixed Input Controls tab reverse button not working and Buttons tab showing wrong text - corrected parameterManagementFunctions.js to send 'reverseParam' instead of 'reverseFormParams', fixed button ID from 'reverse-params-btn' to 'reverseParamsButton', and updated refreshButtonsList to use 'buttonText || buttonName' property for proper display text matching the main template pattern.
2025-01-27: change all the buttons with text 'Copy' to 'Copy List'
2025-07-26: Added auto-submit notification display in form preview when isAutoSubmit=true
2025-07-26: Right-justified 'other' and 'add' type buttons in report grid view action buttons

2025-07-27: Reviewed report details view buttons under lists - Found inconsistency with form details view pattern. Report details view has 4 buttons (Copy, Move Up, Move Down, Reverse) in each tab (columns, buttons, filters) as shown in mainTemplate.js lines 107-111, 128-132, and 149-153. However, Copy functionality is missing from reportDetailsView.js - no copyColumn, copyButton, or copyParam message handlers or functions exist. Form details view documented to have consistent 5-button pattern (Add, Copy, Move Up, Move Down, Reverse) with all functionality implemented. Report details view needs Copy button implementation added to match the expected pattern.

2025-07-27: Fixed copy buttons in report details view - Added missing copy functionality to match form details view pattern. Implemented copyColumn, copyButton, and copyParam message handlers in reportDetailsView.js with functions that create deep copies, append " - Copy" to names for uniqueness, insert copies after originals, and save model. Added complete client-side event handlers in domInitialization.js setupListButtonHandlers function for all 12 list buttons (Copy, Move Up, Move Down, Reverse for columns, buttons, and params tabs). Copy buttons now functional and consistent with established form details view pattern.

2025-07-27: Fixed copy buttons to copy names to clipboard instead of duplicating objects - Corrected misunderstanding of copy functionality. Report details view should copy list item names to clipboard (as shown in backup), not duplicate objects. Replaced object duplication handlers with clipboard copy handlers in domInitialization.js using navigator.clipboard API with fallback. Removed duplicate copy message handlers and functions from reportDetailsView.js. Added missing copyParamsButton handler to form details view parameterManagementFunctions.js. Copy buttons now properly copy item names to clipboard with visual feedback.

2025-07-27: Reviewed move up and move down buttons on report details view tabs - Found missing move button state management functionality. Unlike Form Details view which has proper button enabling/disabling based on selection position, Report Details view lacks list selection change handlers that update move button states. Move buttons should be disabled when no item selected, Move Up disabled when first item selected, Move Down disabled when last item selected. Currently buttons remain enabled in all states, allowing invalid operations. Need to add updateMoveButtonStates function and list selection change handlers for all three tabs (columns, buttons, params).

2025-07-27: Fixed move button state management in report details view - Added comprehensive move button state management with proper disabled/enabled states based on list selection. Implemented updateMoveButtonStates function in clientScriptTemplate.js, added list selection change handlers in domInitialization.js that initialize and update button states on selection changes. Enhanced refresh functions to preserve selection and update button states after list updates. Updated move operation handlers to refresh list displays and maintain proper selection. Fixed backend move functions to pass panel parameter and send targeted refresh messages (refreshColumnsList, refreshButtonsList, refreshParamsList) to avoid full page reloads. Move buttons now properly disabled when no selection, Move Up disabled for first item, Move Down disabled for last item, with immediate UI updates after operations.
