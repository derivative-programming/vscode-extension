2024-12-20: Fixed move button states not updating after move operations in report details view
- Issue: Move up/down buttons' enabled/disabled states were not being updated after move operations
- Root cause: updateMoveButtonStates() function was not called after moveListItem() and reverseList() operations
- Solution: Added calls to updateMoveButtonStates() after selection changes in both functions
- Files modified: src/webviews/reports/components/templates/clientScriptTemplate.js (6 lines added)
- Result: Move buttons now correctly enable/disable based on the new position after moves
