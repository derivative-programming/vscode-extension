August 6, 2025 - User Stories User Journey View Implementation - COMPLETED

2025-08-06 - Implemented User Stories User Journey View
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Request: "copy user story QA view to create user story user journey view. add 'User Journey' treeview item under 'Page Mapping'. replace the status column with a Page column that shows the page that fulfils the user story. remove the notes column. remove the Date Verified column. show a row for each user story and for each page that fulfils it."
- Implementation Details:
  * Created userStoriesJourneyCommands.ts with command handlers and data loading from existing page mapping file
  * Created userStoriesJourneyView.js JavaScript webview with filtering, sorting, and CSV export
  * Created userStoriesJourneyView.ts TypeScript wrapper
  * Added "User Journey" tree item between Page Mapping and QA in jsonTreeDataProvider.ts
  * Added commands to package.json: appdna.userStoriesPageMapping and appdna.userStoriesJourney  
  * Integrated commands in registerCommands.ts with proper panel management
  * Shows a row for each user story and each page that fulfils it (multiple rows per story if multiple pages)
  * Removed QA Status, Notes, and Date Verified columns and replaced with single Page column
  * Uses existing user-story-page-mapping.json file as data source with correct structure: 
    { "pageMappings": { "storyNumber": { "pageMapping": ["page1", "page2"], "ignorePages": [] } } }
  * Architecture: Journey view reads page mapping data and creates expanded view showing story-page relationships
  * Added CSV export functionality matching QA view pattern
  * Shows "Only stories that have completed 'Model AI Processing' are listed." text under title
- FIXED: Corrected data structure reading to use pageMappings.pageMapping array format (not direct pages array)
- Files Created:
  * src/commands/userStoriesJourneyCommands.ts (command registration and data management)
  * src/webviews/userStoriesJourneyView.js (JavaScript webview with table rendering and filtering)
  * src/webviews/userStoriesJourneyView.ts (TypeScript wrapper)
- Files Modified:
  * src/providers/jsonTreeDataProvider.ts (added User Journey tree item)
  * src/commands/registerCommands.ts (integrated journey commands and panel management)
  * package.json (added appdna.userStoriesPageMapping and appdna.userStoriesJourney commands)

August 5, 2025 - User Stories Page Mapping View Implementation - COMPLETED

2025-08-05 - Enhanced page mapping best guess algorithm with camelCase object matching
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED 
- Problem: User stories with multi-word objects like "Org Customers" weren't matching model objects like "OrgCustomers"  
- Solution: Added convertToCamelCase() helper function and updated all matching logic (forms and reports) to try both original and camelCase versions
- ENHANCEMENT: Made all regex patterns fully case-insensitive for robust story text parsing
- Architecture Notes: 
  * Added convertToCamelCase() function in userStoriesPageMappingCommands.ts
  * Updated form matching logic to try exact/partial matches with both object versions
  * Updated report matching logic to try exact/partial matches with both object versions, including visualization type filtering
  * Enhanced logging to show both original and camelCase object names during matching
  * Added client-side convertToCamelCase() function in webview for consistency and debugging
  * Made all regex patterns case-insensitive (view all|VIEW ALL|View All all work the same)
- Files Modified: userStoriesPageMappingCommands.ts, userStoriesPageMappingView.js
- Example: "As a Admin, I want to view all Org Customers in a Organization" → matches Organization grid reports with OrgCustomers targetChildObject
- Matching Strategy Now:
  1. Exact match with original object name + visualization type (for reports)
  2. Exact match with camelCase object name + visualization type (for reports)  
  3. Exact match with original object name (fallback)
  4. Exact match with camelCase object name (fallback)
  5. Partial match with both versions + visualization type
  6. Partial match with both versions (final fallback)

August 5, 2025 - User Stories Page Mapping View Implementation - COMPLETED

## 2025-01-XX: Enhanced Hierarchical Search with Singular/Plural Object Name Matching

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Added comprehensive object name matching for hierarchical parent search

**Problem**: The hierarchical search algorithm was only matching plural object names from user stories against model objects, but model objects are typically defined in singular form (e.g., "CustomerEmailRequest" not "CustomerEmailRequests").

**Solution**: 
- Added `convertToSingular()` function to handle common English pluralization patterns
- Enhanced hierarchical search to try all four combinations:
  1. Original extracted object (e.g., "Customer Email Requests")
  2. CamelCase version (e.g., "CustomerEmailRequests") 
  3. Singular version (e.g., "Customer Email Request")
  4. Singular CamelCase version (e.g., "CustomerEmailRequest")

**Architecture Enhancement**:
- New `convertToSingular()` function handles: -ies→-y, -es→-e/-s, -s→(remove)
- Updated hierarchical parent search to check all object name variations
- Enhanced targetChildObject matching in grid reports with all four forms
- Updated fallback search logic with comprehensive matching
- Enhanced 'view' and form matching with all object name variations

**Example Test Case**: "As a Admin, I want to view all Customer Email Requests in a Customer"
- Extracts: object="Customer Email Requests" 
- Generates: "CustomerEmailRequests", "Customer Email Request", "CustomerEmailRequest"
- Hierarchical search looks for Customer grid reports with targetChildObject="CustomerEmailRequest" (singular)
- Expected match: CustomerAdminEmailRequestList with targetChildObject="CustomerEmailRequest"

**Files Modified**: userStoriesPageMappingCommands.ts
**Benefits**: Now correctly matches model objects regardless of singular/plural naming conventions in user stories vs model definitions.

## 2025-01-XX: Hierarchical Parent Traversal for User Stories Page Mapping
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Feature: Enhanced 'view all' action matching to traverse up parent object hierarchy when searching for grid reports
- Problem: When looking for reports to display all items of a specific object type, the system would only check immediate matches and miss reports defined higher up in the object hierarchy
- Solution: Implemented hierarchical parent traversal that searches up the object tree until it finds matching grid reports
- Architecture Notes:
  * Added findParentObject() helper function to locate parent objects in the namespace
  * Added getParentHierarchy() helper function to build complete parent chain
  * Enhanced 'view all' matching logic to traverse parent hierarchy level by level
  * Maintains preference for grid visualization type reports
  * Stops at first parent level that contains matching reports (doesn't continue searching if found)
  * Falls back to standard matching if no hierarchical matches found
  * 'view' actions still use standard matching (no hierarchy traversal)
- Example Use Cases:
  * "As a Admin, I want to view all Org Customers in a Organization" → searches Customer's parent (Organization) → finds Organization grid reports with targetChildObject="Org Customers" 
  * "As a Admin, I want to view all Organizations in a Customer" → searches Organization's parent (Customer) → finds Customer grid reports with targetChildObject="Organization" (like CustomerAdminOrganizationList)
- Files Modified: userStoriesPageMappingCommands.ts
- Matching Strategy for 'view all':
  1. Get parent hierarchy for target object (immediate parent, grandparent, etc.)
  2. For each parent level, search for grid reports with targetChildObject matching our object
  3. Stop at first parent level that has matching reports
  4. If no hierarchical matches, fall back to standard object matching
- Benefits: Finds reports that logically show collections of child objects even when defined at parent levels

COMPLETED: Enhanced Best Guess to Respect Ignore Pages List
- Status: ✅ ENHANCED  
- Feature: Best guess now filters out pages that are already in ignore list
- Implementation Details:
  * Modified applyBestGuessPageMappings() to check existing ignore pages before applying suggestions
  * Added case-insensitive filtering of suggested pages against ignore list
  * Enhanced logging to show original vs filtered suggestion counts
  * Updated notification count to reflect only successfully applied suggestions
- User Experience: Pages listed in "Ignore Pages" will not be suggested in "Page Mapping" during best guess
- Architecture Note: Filtering happens in webview after suggestions are generated

COMPLETED: Fixed Model Structure Reference for Page Detection
- Status: ✅ FIXED
- Issue: Code was looking for `namespace.dataObject` but model uses `namespace.object` 
- Root Cause: Incorrect model structure assumption - pages are in `object` array not `dataObject` array
- Fix Applied:
  * Changed all references from `namespace.dataObject` to `namespace.object`
  * Updated both validation and best guess generation logic
  * Maintained all existing debug logging for troubleshooting
- Expected Result: Best guess should now find "CustomerAdminUpdate" and other pages in the model

COMPLETED: Enhanced Best Guess Algorithm for Better Page Matching
- Status: ✅ ENHANCED
- Issue: Story "As a Admin, I want to Update a Customer" was not finding form "CustomerAdminUpdate"
- Enhancement Applied:
  * Added comprehensive debug logging for story extraction and page matching
  * Added fourth matching strategy: Role+Object name matching (looks for forms containing both role and object in name)
  * Enhanced existing strategies with detailed logging
  * Added special debug logging for Update Customer stories
- Matching Strategies Now Include:
  1. Exact owner match (ownerObject = object)
  2. Partial owner match (ownerObject contains object)
  3. Direct name match (form name contains object)
  4. Role+Object name match (form name contains both role and object)
- Expected Result: "CustomerAdminUpdate" should now be found via strategy #4

COMPLETED: Fixed Page Detection in Best Guess Algorithm
- Status: ✅ FIXED
- Issue: Best guess algorithm was finding 0 pages in user's model despite having pages
- Root Cause: Code was incorrectly checking for pages at namespace level, but pages are only under dataObjects
- Fix Applied:
  * Removed namespace-level checks for reports and objectWorkflows
  * Focused page detection solely on dataObject arrays
  * Added extensive debug logging for page discovery process
  * Updated both validation and best guess generation logic
- Architecture Note: Reports and objectWorkflows with isPage="true" are always under dataObject arrays, not at namespace level

COMPLETED: Created User Stories Page Mapping View
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "Create a new 'User Story Page Mapping' view. copy the QA view to start"
- Implementation Details:
  * Created userStoriesPageMappingView.js with page mapping and ignore pages functionality
  * Created userStoriesPageMappingView.ts TypeScript wrapper
  * Created userStoriesPageMappingCommands.ts with command handlers
  * Added "Page Mapping" tree item above QA item in jsonTreeDataProvider.ts
  * ADDED: Array storage format (pages stored as arrays instead of strings)
  * ADDED: Ignore Pages filter column
  * ADDED: Validate All Page Names button with validation logic
  * ADDED: Best Guess button for automatic page mapping suggestions
  * Architecture: Page mapping data stored in separate user-story-page-mapping.json file
  * Integrated commands in registerCommands.ts with proper panel management
  * Uses user-story-page-mapping.json file with story number as key (no story text stored)
  * Added CSV export functionality matching QA view pattern
  * Shows "Only stories that have completed 'Model AI Processing' are listed." text under title
- Features:
  * Page Mapping column with textarea for multiple page names (one per line)
  * Ignore Pages column for pages that don't fulfill the story
  * Filtering by story number, story text, and page mapping
  * Sort functionality on story columns
  * Export to CSV with proper workspace saving
  * Same icon button styling as other views
- Architecture: Follows established pattern of QA view with separate JSON file for supplemental data

August 5, 2025 - Role Requirements View Validate Button Background Fix - COMPLETED

COMPLETED: Fixed Role Requirements View Validate Button Background Color
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "lets fix the 'validate all requirements button on the user story role requirements view too"
- Root Cause: Validate button had background color set both in CSS and JavaScript, causing visual inconsistency
- Changes Made:
  * Updated roleRequirementsView.js JavaScript styling to use `background: none` pattern
  * Added `.icon-button` CSS class to roleRequirementsCommands.ts for consistency
  * Changed validateButton HTML class from `validate-button` to `icon-button`
  * Updated hover effects to use `var(--vscode-toolbar-hoverBackground)` pattern
  * Made button styling consistent with export button fix from QA view
- Architecture: All icon buttons now use consistent `background: none` styling pattern across views

August 5, 2025 - User Stories QA View Export Button Background Fix - COMPLETED

COMPLETED: Removed Background Color from User Stories QA Export Button
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY  
- Request: "it seems like the icon button has a background color. remove it"
- Root Cause: QA view was missing the `.icon-button` CSS class definition with `background: none`
- Changes Made:
  * Added `.icon-button` CSS class to userStoriesQACommands.ts matching the working user stories view pattern
  * Set `background: none` and proper hover/focus states for icon buttons
  * Export button now displays as a clean icon without background color
- Architecture: Icon buttons now use consistent styling across both views (user stories and QA)

August 5, 2025 - User Stories QA View Export Button Fix - COMPLETED

COMPLETED: Fixed User Stories QA View Export Button Not Working
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "review the user stories qa view. review the export button. It does not work. We are doing something similar on the user stories view that works correctly"
- Root Cause: QA view was missing the `saveCsvToWorkspace` command handler in the extension
- Changes Made:
  * Added `saveCsvToWorkspace` command handler to userStoriesQACommands.ts following the same pattern as userStoriesView
  * Updated userStoriesQAView.js to send `saveCsvToWorkspace` command instead of attempting direct download
  * Removed unused `downloadCSV` function from QA view
  * Now follows the same workflow as working user stories view: webview → extension generates CSV → webview saves to workspace
- Architecture: Both views now use consistent CSV export pattern: command → generate → save to workspace

August 4, 2025 - QA View Design Update to Match Role Requirements - COMPLETED

COMPLETED: Updated QA View Design to Match Role Requirements View Pattern
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "review the design of the 'role requirements' view. The qa view should be updated to show a similar design."
- Changes Made:
  * Updated header section to use validation-header pattern with descriptive subtitle
  * Redesigned filter section to match role requirements collapsible pattern with chevron icon
  * Updated filter layout to use filter-row and filter-group structure for better organization
  * Applied consistent VS Code theme variables and spacing throughout
  * Updated table container styling to match role requirements border and layout
  * Added proper checkbox column styling for bulk selections
  * Updated bulk actions layout to match role requirements pattern
  * Fixed table footer styling to use simple margin-based layout
  * Updated button styling to use consistent filter-button-secondary class
  * Maintained all existing functionality while improving visual consistency
- Architecture Notes: QA view now follows same design patterns as role requirements view with professional VS Code theme integration

August 4, 2025 - Export Button Consistency Update - COMPLETED

COMPLETED: Updated QA View Export Button to Match User Stories View Pattern
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "review the export button on the user story list view. The export button on the qa view should look and act similar to it"
- Changes Made:
  * Changed QA view export button from custom styling to standard VS Code icon-button class
  * Updated icon from codicon-export to codicon-cloud-download (matches user stories view)
  * Removed text label "Export" to match icon-only pattern of user stories view
  * Removed custom CSS for export-button class since using standard icon-button styling
  * Maintained existing export functionality (exportToCSV command, CSV generation, file download)
- Architecture Notes: Both views now use consistent icon-button styling with cloud-download icon for CSV exports

---

August 4, 2025 - User Stories QA View Implementation - COMPLETED

COMPLETED: Created User Stories QA View with QA Tracking
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY  
- Request: "I need a new view for 'User Stories - QA'. It should use a similar design as the User storiess role requirements view, but i have not determined the filters or columns yet. also add a QA treeview item under the 'Stories' item"
- Updated Requirements: Specific columns, filters, and functionality based on todo.md specifications
- Implementation: Complete QA tracking system following Role Requirements view design patterns

COMPLETED: Fixed Bulk Update and Date Display Issues
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "when i apply status in bulk, the table row is not updated" & "when i set status to Success or failure, the date is not displayed in the date verified column"
- Architecture Pattern: Changed from async message-response pattern to immediate local update pattern (following roleRequirementsView.js)
- Implementation: Local data updates with immediate table re-rendering, proper date handling for success/failure statuses
- Features Fixed:
  * Bulk status updates now update table rows immediately
  * Individual status changes update date verified field immediately when status = success/failure
  * Removed bulkUpdateCompleted message pattern in favor of immediate UI updates
  * Date verification automatically set to current date when status changes to success or failure

COMPLETED: Row Click to Toggle Checkbox
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "on click of the row, change the value of the row checkbox."
- Architecture Pattern: Event delegation with click filtering to avoid conflicts with interactive elements
- Implementation: Added handleRowClick function with intelligent click filtering and checkbox toggling
- Features Added:
  * Click anywhere on table row to toggle checkbox selection
  * Smart filtering prevents conflicts with dropdowns, textareas, and other interactive elements  
  * Visual feedback with cursor pointer and existing hover styles
  * Maintains existing checkbox functionality while adding row-level interaction
  * Updates selection state and apply button state properly

COMPLETED: Fixed Status Dropdown Value Persistence Issue  
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "the status dropdown just shows pending" & "if i change it, it goes back to pending. same for bulk update"
- Root Cause Analysis: Multiple issues causing dropdown value problems
  * Setting dropdown value BEFORE adding option elements (value assignment had no effect)
  * handleQAStatusChange() was calling renderTable() which destroyed all dropdown states
  * Table re-rendering was causing dropdown selections to revert to stored values
- Implementation: Fixed value assignment order and eliminated unnecessary table re-rendering
- Architecture Pattern: Selective DOM updates instead of full table re-rendering for better UX
- Features Fixed:
  * Moved qaStatusSelect.value assignment AFTER options are added to DOM
  * Eliminated renderTable() call in handleQAStatusChange to preserve dropdown states  
  * Added data-story-id attribute to rows for efficient element targeting
  * Implemented selective date cell updates without full table re-render
  * Status dropdowns now properly show and maintain selected values
  * Individual and bulk status changes persist correctly

COMPLETED: Fixed Compilation Error in UserStoriesQA Commands
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "Activating extension 'derivative-programming.appdna' failed: Module parse failed: Unterminated string constant (64:0)"
- Root Cause: Previous edit to fix codicons import accidentally corrupted the import statements and created syntax errors
- Issues Found:
  * Broken import statement: `import { ModelService } from` was corrupted with HTML template code
  * Stray HTML template fragment in middle of imports section
  * String literal corruption causing parsing failures
- Implementation: Clean surgical fixes to restore proper file structure
- Features Fixed:
  * Restored proper import statement: `import { ModelService } from '../services/modelService';`
  * Removed corrupted HTML template fragments from imports section
  * Verified codiconsUri variable is properly defined before HTML template
  * Ensured HTML template string is properly closed with backtick
  * Extension now compiles and activates without errors

COMPLETED: Fixed Refresh Button Icon Display
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Request: "the referesh icon is still not displayed. it should be displayed as we do on the role requirements page" & "review how it imports codicons too"
- Root Cause Analysis: 
  * QA view was importing codicons from 'media/codicon.css' which was just a placeholder file
  * Role requirements view imports from 'node_modules/@vscode/codicons/dist/codicon.css' (the real codicons)
  * Role requirements pattern: Empty HTML button + JavaScript sets innerHTML with icon
  * QA view was trying to use pre-defined HTML icon which couldn't render due to missing CSS
- Implementation: Complete rewrite to match role requirements pattern exactly
- Architecture Pattern: JavaScript-driven icon setup with proper codicons import path
- Features Fixed:
  * Changed codicons import from placeholder 'media/codicon.css' to proper 'node_modules/@vscode/codicons/dist/codicon.css'
  * Updated HTML to empty button like role requirements view
  * Added JavaScript icon setup matching role requirements exactly: innerHTML with span.codicon.codicon-refresh
  * Applied all styling properties from role requirements pattern (background, border, padding, hover effects)
  * Refresh button now properly displays codicon-refresh icon with consistent styling
- Features Added:
  * User Stories QA view with table showing only processed user stories (isStoryProcessed="true")
  * Checkbox column with select all/individual selection functionality
  * Story Number, Story Text, Status (dropdown), Notes (textarea), Date Verified, QA By columns
  * Status options: Pending, Started, Success, Failure
  * Date Verified automatically set when status changes to Success or Failure
  * Filter section with Story Number (textbox), Story Text (textbox), Status (dropdown), QA By filters
  * Sortable columns matching page list design patterns
  * Data stored in separate app-dna-user-story-qa.json file
  * QA tree view item added under Stories in USER STORIES section
  * Bulk Update Selected button for future bulk operations
- Files Created:
  * src/commands/userStoriesQACommands.ts (command registration and data management)
  * src/webviews/userStoriesQAView.js (JavaScript webview with table rendering, filtering, and checkbox selection)
  * src/webviews/userStoriesQAView.ts (TypeScript wrapper)
- Files Modified:
  * src/commands/registerCommands.ts (added command registration and panel management)
  * package.json (added appdna.userStoriesQA command with checklist icon)
  * src/providers/jsonTreeDataProvider.ts (added QA item under Stories)
- Data Structure: Separate JSON file with qaData array containing storyId, qaStatus, qaNotes, dateVerified, qaBy fields
- Architecture: Follows exact same patterns as roleRequirementsView for consistency across extension
- Specifications Met:
  ✅ Only shows stories where isStoryProcessed="true"
  ✅ Checkbox column with select all functionality
  ✅ Correct column names and types
  ✅ Status dropdown with specified values
  ✅ Date verified auto-populated on Success/Failure

August 3, 2025 - Role Requirements View Enhancement - COMPLETED

COMPLETED: Added Validate Button and Comprehensive Validation System
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY  
- Request: "add a validate button to the immediate left of the refresh button. run validation on all rows when clicked. also run validation on all rows after a bulk apply"
- Implementation: Complete validation system with visual feedback and summary reporting
- Features Added:
  * Validate button with check icon positioned left of refresh button
  * validateAllRequirements() function that checks all rows for business rule violations
  * Validation summary panel showing success/error states with detailed breakdown
  * Auto-validation after bulk apply operations with 100ms delay for table rendering
  * Error grouping by validation message type for better readability
  * Auto-hide success messages after 5 seconds
  * Professional VS Code-themed styling for validation UI components
- Files Modified:
  * src/commands/roleRequirementsCommands.ts - Added validate button HTML, CSS styling, validation summary section
  * src/webviews/roleRequirementsView.js - Added validation functions, button setup, auto-validation after bulk apply
- User Experience: Users can now validate all requirements at once and see comprehensive error reports
- Technical Notes: Validation runs client-side using existing validateRoleAccess() function, groups errors by message type, displays up to 10 items per error type

COMPLETED: Fix Role Requirements Apply Button View Update Issue
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Problem: Apply button in Role Requirements view was not updating the table display after bulk access changes
- Root Cause: Missing renderTable() call after bulk changes were applied to local data
- Architecture: Webview message passing pattern with local data updates and separate table rendering
- Files Modified:
  * src/webviews/roleRequirementsView.js - Added renderTable() call in apply button click handler
- Solution: Added renderTable() after bulk access changes to refresh the table display immediately
- Impact: Users can now see updated access levels in the table immediately after clicking "Apply to Selected"
- Technical Notes: handleAccessChange() updates local data arrays but doesn't trigger UI refresh - requires manual renderTable() call

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Redesigned Role Requirements View to Match Page List Design
- User request: "review the user story role requirements view. we are going to redesign it. it will have the same design as the page list view" and "The column is not 'story text', the column is 'Data Object' use names of all data objects. textbox filter" and "values for access will be stored in a separate app-dna-user-story-role-requirements.json file"
- Final specification: Table with columns Role | Data Object | Action | Access, showing all combinations
- Solution: Complete redesign following page list view patterns
  - Created roleRequirementsCommands.ts with full command registration and data loading
  - Created roleRequirementsView.js with table rendering, filtering, and inline editing
  - Table shows all combinations of roles × data objects × actions (View All, View, Add, Update, Delete)
  - Access column has inline dropdowns (Unassigned, Allowed, Required, Not Allowed)
  - Filter section with Role dropdown, Data Object textbox, Action dropdown, Access dropdown
  - Auto-saves changes to separate app-dna-user-story-role-requirements.json file
  - Uses exact same visual design as page list (header, filter section, table container, footer)
  - Sortable columns, refresh functionality, record count display, spinner loading
- BUG FIX: Fixed ModelService API usage error
  - Issue: "TypeError: modelService.getModel is not a function"
  - Root cause: Incorrect API call - method is getCurrentModel(), not getModel()
  - Solution: Updated to use proper ModelService methods (getAllObjects, getAllForms, getAllReports)
- Files: 
  - src/commands/roleRequirementsCommands.ts (complete implementation)
  - src/webviews/roleRequirementsView.js (JavaScript webview matching page list patterns)
  - src/commands/registerCommands.ts (updated imports and command registration)
  - package.json (added command definition with shield icon)
  - src/providers/jsonTreeDataProvider.ts (updated tree view to use new command)
- Data Structure: Separate JSON file with roleRequirements array containing role, dataObject, action, access fields
- Architecture: Follows pageListView patterns exactly for consistency across extension

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Implemented User Story Role Requirements view and command
- User request: "On click of the 'Role Requirements' item open a new 'User Story - Role Requirementviews'" and "call it UserStoryRoleRequirements instead of RoleRequirements" and "rename the two new files too"
- Solution: Created complete role requirements functionality with proper naming and file structure
  - Created userStoryRoleRequirementsView.js with showUserStoryRoleRequirementsView function

  - src/providers/jsonTreeDataProvider.ts (updated command reference)
- Architecture: Following established webview pattern with JS/TS wrapper, proper panel management, and VS Code integration

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Added 'Role Requirements' item to USER STORIES section
- User request: "add a 'Role Requirements' item above 'Stories'"
- Solution: Added new 'Role Requirements' item as first child of USER STORIES section, positioned above existing Stories item
- New item uses contextValue 'userStoriesRoleRequirements' and command 'appdna.showRoleRequirements'
- File modified: src/providers/jsonTreeDataProvider.ts
- Architecture: Extended USER STORIES section with role requirements management capability
- Note: Command 'appdna.showRoleRequirements' needs to be implemented in registerCommands.ts and corresponding view created

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Tree view restructure - Added USER STORIES section and moved Stories
- User request: "review the treeview. add a 'User Stories' treeview item above the 'Data Objects' item. Move the 'user stories' item under the 'Project' item under it and rename it to 'Stories'"
- Solution: 
  - Added new top-level 'USER STORIES' item between PROJECT and DATA OBJECTS
  - Moved existing 'User Stories' from under PROJECT to be child of new USER STORIES section
  - Renamed moved item from 'User Stories' to 'Stories'
  - Updated tree hierarchy order: PROJECT → USER STORIES → DATA OBJECTS → [PAGES] → MODEL SERVICES

- Files modified: src/providers/jsonTreeDataProvider.ts, docs/architecture/tree-view-structure.md
- Architecture: Extended tree view structure with dedicated user stories section, maintaining existing command binding

2025-08-02: for a report grid view filter of datetime i see a dropdown
2025-08-02: check the display of report grid filters too
2025-08-02: review the page preview details view. on a form preview make sure a control of data type 'datetime' shows a date picker and time picker. on date type 'date' its just a date picker
2025-08-02: on sql server data type properties we show a dropdown on many views. The items in this dropdown should be in alpha order
2025-08-02: i see data object details view props tab prop setting Sql Server DB Data Type: dropdown as unsorted
2025-08-02: its the data object details view properties tab list view
2025-08-02: COMPLETED: Fixed all dropdown sorting across entire extension
- User request expanded from SQL Server data type dropdowns to "all tabs of the form details view as well" and "all dropdowns, not just sql server data type"
- Solution: Applied consistent pattern of .slice().sort() before .map() to alphabetically sort all enum-based dropdowns
- Files modified: 

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Created new 'Page List' view feature
- User requested table view similar to model feature catalog showing all pages (forms and reports)
- Solution: Created complete page list implementation with sorting, filtering, and action buttons
- Files created:
  - src/commands/pageListCommands.ts (command registration and data loading from ModelService)
  - src/webviews/pageListView.js (JavaScript webview with table, sorting, filtering)
- Files modified:
  - package.json (added appdna.pageList command and table icon menu item for PAGES tree item)
- Architecture: Uses ModelService.getAllObjects() to extract forms/reports where isPage='true', provides preview and details buttons
- Tree integration: PAGES item already had 'showPageList' context value, table icon now appears on PAGES tree item 
  * Report templates (14+ files): All columnTableTemplate, parameterTableTemplate, etc.
  * Object templates (7+ files): All propertiesTableTemplate, settingsTemplate, lookupItemsTemplate, etc.
  * Form templates (9+ files): All settingsTabTemplate, paramsTableTemplate, modalTemplates, buttonsTableTemplate, etc.
  * Script files: parameterManagementFunctions.js
- Pattern used: schema.enum.slice().sort().map() instead of schema.enum.map()
- Total enum patterns fixed: 25+ locations across webview templates
- Verification: Final grep search confirmed no remaining unsorted enum patterns

2025-08-02: review the page preview view report grid preview.  There is a scrollbar at the bottom under the paging and export controls. it shoudl be between the table and paging controls
COMPLETED: Fixed report grid scrollbar positioning in page preview
- Issue: Horizontal scrollbar appeared below both pagination controls and export buttons
- Solution: Restructured HTML to separate scrollable table area from pagination/export controls
- Added report-grid-wrapper as outer container with borders
- report-grid-container now contains only the scrollable table with overflow-x: auto
- Pagination controls positioned after scrollable area, export buttons after pagination
- Updated CSS to remove redundant borders since wrapper handles borders
- Result: Horizontal scrollbar now correctly positioned between table and pagination controls
- File modified: src/webviews/pagepreview/components/htmlGenerator.js

2025-08-03: COMPLETED: Page List View UI improvements
- User requested three changes to page list view:
  1. ✅ Refresh icon button already implemented correctly (matches model feature catalog pattern)
  2. ✅ Removed 'Apply Filters' button - filters now work immediately on change (real-time filtering with 300ms debounce)
  3. ✅ Removed 'List' report type from dropdown and data processing logic (does not exist)
- Solution: Modified HTML template to remove apply filters button while keeping clear filters button, updated report type dropdown options, removed 'list' visualization type mapping
- CORRECTION: Added back 'Clear All' button after user pointed out it was needed to reset filter fields
- Files modified: 
  - src/commands/pageListCommands.ts (HTML template and data processing logic)
- Architecture: Filters already had real-time functionality with debounced input events, just removed manual apply button
- Result: Cleaner UI with immediate filter feedback, clear all functionality preserved, accurate report type options

## 2025-01-XX: Application-Level Context Detection for User Stories

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Added special case handling for application-level scope in user stories

**Problem**: User stories like "As a Admin, I want to view all Organizations in the application" should target top-level parent objects (Pac, Tac, or root) rather than following normal hierarchical parent traversal.

**Solution**: 
- Added `isApplicationLevelContext()` function to detect phrases like "in the application", "in the app", "application-wide"
- Added `findTopLevelParent()` function to locate Pac, Tac, or root-level objects (objects without parents)
- Enhanced 'view all' action logic to check for application context before hierarchical search

**Architecture Enhancement**:
- New context detection checks story text for application-level indicators
- Top-level parent discovery identifies objects that are not children of any other objects
- Special handling prioritizes application-scope over hierarchical parent traversal
- Maintains backward compatibility with normal hierarchical search for non-application stories

**Integration Points**:
- Enhanced generateBestGuessPageMappings handler in userStoriesPageMappingCommands.ts
- Application context check occurs before normal hierarchical parent search
- Uses same 4-form object matching (original, camelCase, singular, singularCamelCase) for consistency

**Example Test Case**: "As a Admin, I want to view all Organizations in the application"
- Detects: Application-level context from "in the application"
- Targets: Top-level parent (Pac/Tac/root) instead of Organization's normal parent
- Result: Finds grid reports in top-level parent showing Organizations
