2025-08-10T00:00:00Z | review-user-story-role-requirements-view | Reviewed the 'User Stories - Role Requirements' view implementation - COMPLETED
- Located view in src/webviews/userStoryRoleRequirementsView.js (JavaScript) with TypeScript wrapper
- Found view registration as 'appdna.showUserStoryRoleRequirements' command in registerCommands.ts

- Planned features: role selection, object/property-level permissions grid, bulk assignment, user story generation, validation
- Status: completed

2025-08-10T00:00:00Z | review-user-stories-modal-format | Reviewed user stories list add modal to determine correct story format - COMPLETED
- Located modal in userStoriesView.js with multi-line textarea supporting one story per line
- Documented 4 supported format patterns with regex validation:
  1. "A [Role] wants to [action] [a|an] [object]" (single object actions)
  2. "A [Role] wants to view all [objects] in a [container]" (view all format)
  3. "As a [Role], I want to [action] [a|an] [object]" (alternate single format)
  4. "As a [Role], I want to view all [objects] in a [container]" (alternate view all)
- Validation requirements: role must exist in model, data objects must exist (except "application"), no duplicates
- Actions supported: view, add, create, update, edit, delete, remove (create/edit normalized to add/update)
- Special case: "in the application" is allowed without validating "application" as data object
- Architecture: Real-time validation with line-by-line error reporting, role/object existence validation
