Command: Auto-refresh tab after modal save (Details, Board, Forecast)
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ENHANCEMENT REQUEST:
When the story detail modal is saved, the current tab should refresh to show
the updated data. This should work consistently across all tabs:
- Details tab
- Board tab
- Forecast tab

IMPLEMENTATION:
Added `refreshCurrentTab()` function in modalFunctionality.js that:
1. Detects the currently active tab using global `currentTab` variable
2. Calls the appropriate refresh/render function for that tab:
   - Details tab → renderDetailsTab()
   - Board tab → refreshBoard()
   - Forecast tab → refreshForecast()
   - Analysis tab → renderAnalysisTab()
   - Sprint tab → renderSprintTab()

Modified `saveStoryDetails()` to:
1. Close modal first (for better UX)
2. Call refreshCurrentTab() to update the view

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/modalFunctionality.js

BEHAVIOR:
- Modal saves changes to item in allItems array
- Modal sends saveDevChange message to extension
- Modal closes
- Current tab refreshes automatically to show updated data
- User sees immediate visual feedback without manual refresh

BENEFITS:
✅ Consistent behavior across all tabs
✅ Immediate visual feedback after save
✅ No need for manual refresh
✅ Better user experience

Command: Fix Gantt chart click to open story modal - storyId mismatch
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
Clicking on Gantt chart items (bars or labels) resulted in error:
"Item not found: 2" - The modal couldn't find the story in allItems array.

ROOT CAUSE:
In forecastFunctions.js, calculateStorySchedules() was creating schedule objects 
with incorrect storyId mapping:
- Was: `storyId: story.storyNumber || story.id` (e.g., "2")
- Needed: `storyId: story.storyId` (the actual unique identifier/UUID)

The modal searches for items using `allItems.find(i => i.storyId === storyId)`, 
so it needs the actual storyId field, not the display number.

FIX APPLIED:
1. In forecastFunctions.js line 180:
   - Changed to use `story.storyId` for the storyId field
   - Added separate `storyNumber` field for display purposes
   
2. In ganttChart.js:
   - Updated Y-axis labels to display `d.storyNumber || d.storyId`
   - Updated tooltip to display `d.storyNumber || d.storyId`
   - Kept click handlers using `d.storyId` (correct for lookup)

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/forecastFunctions.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/ganttChart.js

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Story objects have two ID fields:
  - `storyId`: Unique identifier (UUID) used for lookups
  - `storyNumber`: Display number shown to users (e.g., "2", "5")
- Schedule objects now include both fields for proper operation
- Click handlers must pass storyId for modal lookup
- Display elements should show storyNumber for user readability

Command: Add debug logging to diagnose dev status issue in forecast
Status: IN PROGRESS - DEBUGGING
================================================================================

ISSUE:
After fixing property mappings, the Gantt chart tooltip still shows "On-Hold" 
status instead of the actual status (e.g., "Critical"). Need to investigate 
why the dev status data isn't being correctly used.

DEBUGGING APPROACH:
Added console.log statements to trace the data flow:

1. At start of calculateDevelopmentForecast():
   - Logs sample item structure (full JSON)
   - Logs count of total, incomplete, and completed items
   
2. In calculateStorySchedules():
   - Logs each story's devStatus, priority, and assignedTo values
   - Shows what data is actually being used to build schedules

NEXT STEPS:
1. Reload the extension and open Dev Console
2. Navigate to Forecast tab
3. Check console logs to see:
   - What devStatus values are in the items
   - Whether the dev file data is actually being merged
   - If status is "on-hold", determine why it's not loading from dev file

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/forecastFunctions.js (added logging)

Command: Fix forecast data property mapping to use correct field names
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
The Gantt chart tooltip was showing incorrect dev status (e.g., "On-Hold" when 
the actual status was "Critical" or another status). The forecast tab was not 
properly loading the dev status data from the app-dna-user-story-dev.json file
where status changes are saved.

ROOT CAUSE:
Property name mismatch in forecastFunctions.js when building story schedules:
1. The combined data uses `storyText` but schedule builder was accessing `story.story`
2. The combined data uses `assignedTo` but schedule builder was accessing `story.developer`

This caused the schedule to pull the wrong property values, likely getting undefined
or default values instead of the actual saved dev status and other fields.

SOLUTION:
Updated the schedule building in forecastFunctions.js to use the correct property
names with fallbacks:

```javascript
storyText: story.storyText || story.story || '',
developer: story.assignedTo || story.developer || "Unassigned",
```

This ensures:
1. Story text is pulled from the correct property
2. Developer/assigned-to is pulled from the correct property
3. Fallbacks ensure compatibility if property names vary
4. Dev status and other fields are correctly mapped from the loaded dev file

PROPERTY MAPPING:
The extension loads dev data from `app-dna-user-story-dev.json` and merges it
with user stories from the model. The combined data structure uses:
- `storyText` (not `story`)
- `assignedTo` (not `developer`)
- `devStatus` (correctly mapped)
- `priority`, `storyPoints`, etc. (all from dev file)

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/forecastFunctions.js

VERIFICATION:
The data flow is:
1. Extension loads app-dna-user-story-dev.json (line 87-96 in userStoriesDevCommands.ts)
2. Creates devLookup map from dev data (line 99-103)
3. Merges dev data with user stories (line 194: devStatus: existingDev?.devStatus)
4. Sends combined data to webview
5. Forecast calculations now correctly use the merged data

USER BENEFIT:
- Gantt chart tooltips now show the correct, up-to-date dev status
- Status changes made in the details tab are properly reflected in the forecast
- Developer assignments are correctly displayed
- All forecast data is synchronized with the saved dev file

Command: Fix Gantt chart to display dev status colors correctly
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
On the forecast tab, the Gantt chart bars were not displaying the correct dev
status. The bars were being colored by developer assignment instead of by 
development status, making it difficult to see which stories were on-hold, 
in-progress, blocked, etc.

ROOT CAUSE:
In ganttChart.js, the bar fill color was using:
  `.attr("fill", d => developerColorScale(developerIndices[d.developer]))`

This colored the bars by developer, not by dev status. Although a 
`devStatusColorScale` was defined, it was never actually used.

SOLUTION:
Changed the bar fill attribute to use dev status coloring:
  `.attr("fill", d => devStatusColorScale(d.devStatus))`

The devStatusColorScale maps statuses to colors:
- on-hold: #858585 (gray)
- ready-for-dev: #0078d4 (blue)
- in-progress: #f39c12 (orange)
- blocked: #d73a49 (red)
- completed: #10b981 (green)

VERIFICATION:
Confirmed that storySchedules objects include devStatus property (line 183 in
forecastFunctions.js), so the data is available for coloring.

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/ganttChart.js (line 342)

VISUAL RESULT:
- Gantt chart bars now display with colors matching the dev status
- Easy to identify on-hold (gray), in-progress (orange), blocked (red) stories
- Developer information is still shown in the tooltip
- Status is also displayed in the tooltip with proper formatting

USER BENEFIT:
Users can now quickly visualize the development status of stories in the 
timeline, making it easier to identify bottlenecks, blocked stories, and
overall project health at a glance.

Command: Implement automatic refresh when switching tabs
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
When switching between tabs in the user story dev view, the tab content was not
automatically refreshed, requiring manual refresh button clicks to see updated
data or recalculated analytics.

SOLUTION:
Modified the `switchTab()` function in userStoryDevView.js to automatically call
the appropriate refresh function for each tab after rendering:

1. **Details Tab**: Calls `refreshData()` to fetch fresh data from extension
2. **Analysis Tab**: Calls `refreshAnalytics()` to recalculate charts and metrics
3. **Board Tab**: Calls `refreshBoard()` to re-render the kanban board
4. **Sprint Tab**: No additional refresh needed (renders fresh on switch)
5. **Forecast Tab**: Calls `refreshForecast()` to recalculate forecast data

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Added function existence checks (`typeof refreshData === 'function'`) to
  prevent errors if refresh functions are not loaded
- Each tab's refresh function is called after the initial render
- Details tab specifically requests fresh data from the extension
- Other tabs recalculate/re-render using the current in-memory data
- Spinner overlays are shown during refresh operations

BEHAVIOR:
- User switches to a tab → Content renders → Data automatically refreshes
- Eliminates need to manually click refresh buttons after switching tabs
- Ensures user always sees the most current data/calculations when viewing a tab

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/userStoryDevView.js (switchTab function)

USER BENEFIT:
Users no longer need to remember to click the refresh button when switching tabs.
Tab data is always fresh and up-to-date automatically.

Command: Align Refresh button to the right in analytics tab and add missing CSS
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
The Refresh button in the user story dev view analytics tab needed to be right-
justified. Additionally, several CSS classes used in the template were missing 
from the webview stylesheet, causing layout issues.

ROOT CAUSE:
1. The template used `.analysis-header` but there was no corresponding CSS
2. Missing CSS for several classes: `.analysis-container`, `.analysis-controls`,
   `.metrics-grid`, `.charts-section`, `.chart-subtitle`, `.chart-large`, 
   `.data-table-section`, `.table-header`
3. The `.chart-header` was using flex-row layout but the template uses h4 and
   subtitle in a column layout

SOLUTION:
Added comprehensive CSS for the analytics tab in userStoriesDevCommands.ts:

1. **`.analysis-header`** - Uses flexbox with `justify-content: space-between`
   to push the refresh button to the right
   
2. **`.analysis-controls`** - Container for the refresh button with flex display

3. **`.metrics-grid`** - Grid layout for metric cards

4. **`.charts-section`** - Grid layout for charts with auto-fit columns

5. **`.chart-header`** - Changed to flex-column to support h4 + subtitle layout

6. **Other supporting classes** - Added `.chart-subtitle`, `.chart-large`, 
   `.data-table-section`, `.table-header` for complete tab styling

CSS CHANGES:
- Added `.analysis-container` - Container styling
- Added `.analysis-header` - Flex layout with space-between for right alignment
- Added `.analysis-header h3` - Header text styling
- Added `.analysis-controls` - Controls container
- Added `.metrics-grid` - Grid for metrics
- Added `.charts-section` - Grid for charts
- Added `.chart-subtitle` - Subtitle styling
- Added `.chart-large` - Full-width charts
- Added `.data-table-section` - Table section
- Added `.table-header` and `.table-header h4` - Table header styling
- Modified `.chart-header` - Changed to flex-column for proper layout
- Added `.chart-header h4` - Header styling within charts

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts (CSS styling in getWebviewContent)

VISUAL RESULT:
- Refresh button is now right-aligned in the analytics tab header
- "Development Analytics" title on the left, refresh button on the right
- All charts and metrics display properly with consistent styling
- Responsive grid layouts work correctly

Command: Align Download CSV and Refresh buttons to the right in details tab
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
The Download CSV and Refresh buttons in the user story dev view details tab 
needed to be right-justified to improve the UI layout.

SOLUTION:
Added `justify-content: space-between` to the `.action-bar` CSS class in the 
webview content. This flexbox property pushes the second `.action-group` 
(containing the Download CSV and Refresh buttons) to the right side of the 
action bar, while keeping the first group (Bulk action buttons) on the left.

CSS CHANGE:
- Modified `.action-bar` in userStoriesDevCommands.ts getWebviewContent()
- Added: justify-content: space-between;

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts (CSS styling in getWebviewContent)

VISUAL RESULT:
- Bulk action buttons (Status, Priority, Assignment, Sprint) remain on the left
- Download CSV and Refresh icon buttons are now aligned to the right
- Layout properly responds to flex-wrap when window is narrowed

Command: Fix user story dev view details tab - devFilePath error
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
When setting priority (or other fields) on a user story in the dev view details 
tab, the extension was throwing an error:
  "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'devFilePath')"

ROOT CAUSE:
The webview scripts were sending messages to the extension in the wrong format:
- Webview was sending: { command: 'saveDevChange', storyId: X, changes: {...} }
- Extension expected: { command: 'saveDevChange', data: { complete dev record } }

The extension handler at userStoriesDevCommands.ts line 447 was accessing 
`message.data.devFilePath`, but the data property didn't exist because the 
webview wasn't wrapping the payload correctly.

SOLUTION:
1. Created a helper function `buildDevRecord(item)` in userStoryDevView.js that 
   builds a complete dev record with all required fields including devFilePath

2. Updated 6 webview script files to use this helper function:
   - priorityManagement.js (handlePriorityChange)
   - devStatusManagement.js (handleDevStatusChange)
   - modalFunctionality.js (saveStoryDetails)
   - storyPointsManagement.js (handleStoryPointsChange)
   - assignmentManagement.js (handleDeveloperAssignment, handleSprintAssignment)

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- The devFilePath is sent to the webview as part of each item in the initial data
- Each item in allItems array contains all dev record fields including devFilePath
- All single-item save operations must send the COMPLETE dev record, not partial changes
- The extension rebuilds the entire record and saves it to the dev file
- Bulk operations use separate commands (bulkUpdateDevStatus, etc.) and don't need devFilePath in each item

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/userStoryDevView.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/priorityManagement.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/devStatusManagement.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/modalFunctionality.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/storyPointsManagement.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/assignmentManagement.js

TESTING RECOMMENDATION:
Test all single-field changes in the details tab:
- Priority dropdown
- Dev Status dropdown
- Story Points dropdown
- Developer assignment
- Sprint assignment
- Edit modal (all fields)
