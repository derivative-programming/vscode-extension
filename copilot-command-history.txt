2025-08-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Implement "Subscribe to Owner Data Object Properties" checkbox in report columns tab
- Added checkbox in columns tab list view after list buttons 
- Checkbox controls propSubscription entries with destinationContextObjectName=ObjectName, destinationTargetName=ReportName
- When checked: sets isIgnored="false" (or creates new entry if none exists)
- When unchecked: sets isIgnored="true" (creates entry if needed)
- Added CSS styling for .subscription-controls container with VS Code theming
- Added JavaScript handlers for checkbox toggle and state initialization
- Added backend functions: getOwnerSubscriptionState() and updateOwnerSubscription()
- Added message handlers: getOwnerSubscriptionState, updateOwnerSubscription, setOwnerSubscriptionState
- Uses ModelService.getReportOwnerObject() to find parent object for propSubscription management
- Properly handles edge cases: missing propSubscription array, missing owner object, etc.
Architecture Notes:
- Checkbox state automatically initialized on tab load by querying current propSubscription
- Uses owner object's propSubscription array (not report's) per specification
- Maintains existing subscription entries and only modifies isIgnored flag
- Full integration with existing undo/save workflow via modelService.markUnsavedChanges()

2025-08-16: ✅ COMPLETED - Implement comprehensive ModelService getter methods
- Added getReport(reportName) - finds specific report by name
- Added getForm(formName) - finds specific form (objectWorkflow with isPage=true) by name  
- Added getPage(pageName) - finds either report or form page by name
- Added getObject(objectName) - finds specific object by name
- Added getReportOwnerObject(reportName) - finds object that owns a specific report
- Added getFormOwnerObject(formName) - finds object that owns a specific form
- Added getPageOwnerObject(pageName) - finds object that owns a specific page (report or form)
- Added getAllPages() - returns all pages (reports with isPage=true + all forms)
- Existing methods: getAllObjects(), getAllReports(), getAllForms()
Architecture Notes: 
- All methods use case-insensitive name matching with trim()
- Owner methods iterate through objects to find containing arrays
- Page methods handle both report and form types
- Null safety with proper fallbacks
- Maintains singleton pattern and existing caching behavior
