2025-10-12 18:00 - Add Cost Tab to QA View
Command: Implemented Cost Analysis tab for QA View to show monthly cost breakdown by tester
Status: Completed
Notes: Added cost tab following Dev View pattern but adapted for QA-specific data.
Created qaCostTabTemplate.js (184 lines) with functions: generateQACostTab(), generateQACostAnalysisTable(),
generateTesterRows(), generateQATotalRow(). Template generates table with monthly columns, filter checkboxes,
summary cards, and CSV download/refresh actions.
Created qaCostAnalysisFunctions.js (240 lines) with functions: calculateQAMonthlyCosts(), refreshQACostAnalysis(),
downloadQACostCsv(). Calculation logic: storyCost = avgTestTime × defaultQARate. Uses QA forecast to get tester
assignments and dates. Groups costs by month and tester. Filters by past/future/current months.
Date priority: qaActualEndDate (completed) → forecast startDate → qaStartDate → qaEstimatedEndDate.
Modified userStoriesQACommands.ts: Added cost tab button (line ~1794), cost tab HTML (lines ~2074-2083),
cost tab CSS styles (lines ~1783-1939), script URIs (lines ~346-347), script tags (lines ~2211-2212).
CSS: 160+ lines for .cost-tab-container, .cost-header, .cost-filters, .cost-table, .tester-column (sticky),
.month-column (with current-month highlighting), .cost-cell, .cost-summary, .summary-card.
Modified userStoriesQAView.js: Added cost tab logic to switchTab() (lines ~2094-2105),
added renderQACostAnalysis() function (lines ~2108-2127).
Features: Monthly cost breakdown, tester rows, total row, filters (past/future/current), CSV export,
summary cards (total/average/peak costs), sticky headers and first column, current month highlighting.
Architecture follows three-layer pattern: Template (HTML generation) → Calculation (cost logic) → Integration (tab wiring).
Adaptations from Dev View: "Developer" → "Tester", developer rates → QA rates, story points → test hours,
dev forecast → QA forecast. Pattern ensures consistency between Dev and QA cost tabs.

2025-01-13 16:30 - Add Zoom Controls to QA View Forecast Gantt Chart
Command: Implemented zoom controls for QA forecast Gantt chart to match Dev View functionality
Status: Completed (Updated 2025-10-12 for correct pixel widths)
Notes: Added timeline zoom controls between Project Overview and Gantt chart with 5 buttons:
Hour (40px per hour), Day (50px per day), Week (80px per week), Month (100px per month), Reset.
HTML: Timeline controls div with codicon buttons (watch, dash, menu, three-bars, screen-normal).
CSS: 60+ lines of styles for .timeline-controls, .timeline-btn, .timeline-control-label with hover effects.
JavaScript: Added currentQAZoomLevel state variable (default 'hour'), zoomQAGanttChart(zoomLevel) function
that triggers calculateAndRenderForecast() to re-render chart at new scale.
Modified renderForecastGantt() to use dynamic pixel width per time unit (not per hour for all views).
Time unit generation: hour view generates hours, day generates days, week generates weeks, month generates months.
Header rendering: hour view shows two rows (day headers + hour labels), other views show single row (date/week/month only).
Pattern follows Dev View implementation from forecastTabTemplate.js and ganttChart.js.
**Fix (2025-10-12)**: Corrected pixel widths to be per time unit (day=50px per day, not 10px per hour).
**Fix (2025-10-12)**: Fixed month/week view positioning for items in the last time unit - was breaking early without calculating position for items that fell in the final month/week of the timeline.
**Fix (2025-10-12)**: Critical - Normalized startDate/endDate to align with time unit boundaries (month view starts at day 1 of month, week view starts on Sunday, day view starts at midnight) to ensure timeline headers and positioning use consistent reference points. Applied to BOTH QA View and Dev View.
Architecture: Modified src/commands/userStoriesQACommands.ts (added timeline-controls HTML after qa-project-overview div,
60+ lines CSS), modified src/webviews/userStoriesQAView.js (added currentQAZoomLevel variable, zoomQAGanttChart function,
dynamic hourWidth switch statement in renderForecastGantt).
Created docs/architecture/qa-view-zoom-controls-implementation.md.

================================================================================

2025-01-13 16:00 - Fix Webpack Not Copying Root-Level Webview Files
Command: Updated webpack.config.js to copy all root-level webview JS files and additional subdirectories
Status: Completed
Notes: Extension was failing to activate with "Cannot find module '../webviews/addObjectWizardView'" error.
Root cause: CopyWebpackPlugin was only copying subdirectories (objects/, reports/) but not root-level files.
Added pattern to copy src/webviews/*.js → dist/webviews/, plus pageflow/ and userStoryDev/ subdirectories.
Now copies 42 root-level JS files including all wizard views, QA view, user stories view, etc.
Build succeeds with 2.2 MiB of webview assets emitted, extension activates successfully.
Architecture: Modified webpack.config.js CopyWebpackPlugin patterns.
Created docs/fixes/webpack-webview-files-not-copied-fix.md.

================================================================================

2025-01-13 15:45 - Fix Function Name Collision in QA Project Overview
Command: Renamed calculateQARecommendations calculation function to avoid collision with HTML generation function
Status: Completed
Notes: Runtime error "recommendations.map is not a function" caused by two functions named generateQARecommendations:
one for calculating recommendations (returns array), one for generating HTML (expects array parameter).
Renamed calculation function from generateQARecommendations → calculateQARecommendations to follow naming convention:
calculate* for data functions, generate* for HTML generation functions.
Architecture: Modified src/webviews/userStoriesQAView.js (renamed function at line ~1123, updated call at line ~1005).
Created docs/fixes/qa-project-overview-function-name-collision-fix.md.

================================================================================

2025-01-13 15:30 - Add Project Overview Section to QA View Forecast Tab
Command: Implemented comprehensive Project Overview section in QA forecast tab with metrics, risk assessment, and recommendations
Status: Completed
Notes: Added Project Overview section similar to Dev View but adapted for QA-specific metrics:
- 6 metric cards in responsive grid: Projected Completion (risk-colored), Remaining Hours, Remaining Work Days, 
  Stories to Test (replaces Team Velocity), Total QA Cost, Remaining QA Cost
- Risk assessment algorithm with 4 factors: story-to-tester ratio, timeline pressure, test time, blocked stories
- Bottleneck identification: resource constraints, long test times, blocked stories
- Recommendations engine: priority-coded actionable guidance
- Collapsible section with toggle (chevron icon)
- Cost calculations using qaConfig.defaultQARate
- Extended calculateQAForecast() to return object with items array and additional metrics
- Updated all callers to use forecastResult.items instead of direct array
Architecture: Modified src/webviews/userStoriesQAView.js (added 200+ lines: assessQARisk, identifyQABottlenecks,
calculateQARecommendations, updateProjectOverview, generateQAForecastMetric, generateQARiskAssessment, 
generateQARecommendations, toggleQAProjectOverview functions; modified calculateQAForecast to return extended object).
Modified src/commands/userStoriesQACommands.ts (added qa-project-overview div, 200+ lines of CSS for metric cards,
risk sections, recommendations styling). Created docs/architecture/qa-view-project-overview-implementation.md.

================================================================================

2025-10-12 10:25 - Fix Duplicate Dollar Signs in Forecast Tab
Command: Removed manual "$" symbols from cost metrics in forecast tab
Status: Completed
Notes: The forecast tab was showing duplicate dollar signs (e.g., "$$27,250" or "S$27,250").
This was caused by both:
1. The "symbol-currency" codicon which displays a currency symbol
2. Manual "$" in the template string: `$${formatCurrency(...)}`
Removed the manual "$" from both "Total Project Cost" and "Remaining Work Cost" metrics.
Now displays correctly with just the currency icon and the formatted number.
Architecture: Modified src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/forecastTabTemplate.js,
removed "$" prefix from generateForecastMetric calls for cost metrics.

================================================================================

2025-10-12 10:20 - Update Cost Tab Export Button Design to Match Details Tab
Command: Changed export button from text button (btn-secondary) to icon-button to match Details tab design
Status: Completed
Notes: Export button was using "btn btn-secondary" class with text "Export CSV" and icon.
Changed to match Details tab design: "icon-button" class with only icon (no text), shows text in tooltip.
Changed from <span class="codicon"> to <i class="codicon"> for consistency.
Both export and refresh buttons now have consistent icon-button styling.
Architecture: Modified src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/costTabTemplate.js,
updated button classes in cost-actions div.

================================================================================

2025-10-12 10:15 - Fix Cost Tab CSV Export to Open File Immediately
Command: Updated downloadCostCsv() to use same pattern as Details tab export (save to workspace and open)
Status: Completed
Notes: Cost tab was using old browser-side blob download method (download to browser downloads folder).
Changed to use extension-side save method matching Details tab:
- Sends 'saveCsvToWorkspace' message to extension with CSV content and filename
- Extension saves to workspace's user_story_reports folder
- Extension opens the CSV file immediately with vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.open')
- Uses timestamped filename: user_story_cost_analysis_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.csv
This provides consistent UX across all exports and opens the file automatically for user review.
Architecture: Modified src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/costAnalysisFunctions.js,
changed downloadCostCsv() from blob download to vscode.postMessage pattern.
Uses existing saveCsvToWorkspace handler in src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts.

================================================================================

2025-10-12 10:00 - Remove Unimplemented Sprint Summary Section from Analysis Tab
Command: Removed empty "Sprint Summary" placeholder section from Analysis tab
Status: Completed
Notes: The Sprint Summary section was just a placeholder with no implementation.
Removed the entire "Data Table Section" div containing Sprint Summary header and empty table body.
This cleans up the Analysis tab UI by removing non-functional elements.
The section was listed as a "future enhancement" in documentation but never implemented.
Architecture: Modified src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/analysisTabTemplate.js,
removed data-table-section div with sprintSummaryTable element.

================================================================================

2025-10-12 09:45 - Move Analysis Tab to Last Position in User Story Dev View
Command: Reordered tabs to move Analysis tab from 3rd position to last (8th position)
Status: Completed
Notes: Moved Analysis tab button in tab bar from 3rd position (after Dev Queue) to 8th position (after Cost).
New tab order: Details, Dev Queue, Board, Sprint, Developers, Forecast, Cost, Analysis.
This provides better workflow as users work through tactical tabs before viewing analytics.
Architecture: Modified src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts HTML template, tab button order only.
Tab content divs remain in same order (doesn't affect functionality).

================================================================================

2025-10-12 09:30 - Fix Data Object Name Resolution (Plural to Singular)
Command: Added resolveDataObjectName() to convert extracted names to actual model object names
Status: Completed
Notes: Previously, extracted "customers" would not resolve to "Customer" in model, showing rank 999.
Added resolveDataObjectName() function that uses isDataObjectMatch() to find actual object in model.
Now getPrimaryDataObjectForStory() resolves extracted names (e.g., "customers", "customer email request") 
to actual model names (e.g., "Customer", "CustomerEmailRequest") before calculating rank.
Logs show both extracted name and resolved name for debugging.
Filters out any extracted names that can't be resolved to model objects.
Example: "view all Customers" extracts "customers", resolves to "Customer", gets correct rank.
Architecture: Webview JS only in src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/dataObjectRankCalculator.js, 
added resolveDataObjectName() and updated getPrimaryDataObjectForStory().

================================================================================

2025-10-12 09:15 - Fix "View All" Target Object Detection
Command: Fixed getPrimaryDataObjectForStory() to correctly identify target object in "view all X in Y" patterns
Status: Completed
Notes: Previously, "view all Organizations in a Customer" would incorrectly use Customer (parent, rank 1) as the target.
Now correctly identifies Organizations (the object being viewed) as the target for "view all" actions.
For "view all" action: uses FIRST extracted object (the one being viewed).
For other actions: uses LOWEST RANK object (highest priority in hierarchy).
Example: "view all Organizations in a Customer" now correctly targets Organization, not Customer.
Architecture: Webview JS only in src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/dataObjectRankCalculator.js, modified getPrimaryDataObjectForStory() function.

================================================================================

2025-10-11 16:45 - Add Action-Based Sorting to Calculate Queue Position Feature
Command: Enhanced dataObjectRankCalculator.js with action extraction and three-level sorting
Status: Completed
Notes: Added extractActionFromUserStory() and getActionOrder() functions based on userStoriesView.js patterns. 
Sort order now: (1) data object rank, (2) data object name (alphabetic), (3) action order (Add=0, View All=1, View=2, Update=3, Delete=4, Other=5).
Updated getPrimaryDataObjectForStory() to return action data, updated handleDataObjectRankingResponse() to use three-level sort, updated console logs to show action info.
Architecture: Webview JS only in src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/dataObjectRankCalculator.js

================================================================================

2025-10-11 15:22 - Fix Gantt hour-boundary positioning
Command: Adjusted dateToPixelPosition hour logic in src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/ganttChart.js
Status: Completed
Notes: Prevented premature break when target equals unit start; now adds full hours only when target >= nextUnit and breaks on exact start. Ensures 1pm–5pm story renders 4-hour width. Architecture: Webview JS only; no TS changes; respects working-hours boundary (9–17), with 17 as cap.

================================================================================
Date: October 11, 2025
Command: Fix Export and Refresh - Correct Implementation Pattern
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

BUG FIX - ARCHITECTURE:
User reported both refresh and export buttons not working.
Error: "Uncaught ReferenceError: getAssignedStoryCount is not defined"

ROOT CAUSE:
Functions were implemented incorrectly, not following the Details tab pattern.

PROBLEMS:

1. exportDevelopersToCSV() - Wrong Implementation:
   - Tried to generate CSV entirely in webview (client-side)
   - Called non-existent getAssignedStoryCount() function
   - Didn't have access to user story assignment data
   - 45+ lines of complex CSV generation code in wrong place

2. refreshDevelopers() - Wrong Implementation:
   - Only called renderDevelopersTab() (re-rendered current data)
   - Didn't request fresh data from extension
   - Didn't reload files from disk

CORRECT PATTERN (from Details tab):

Both functions should send messages to extension:
```javascript
function refreshData() {
    showSpinner();
    vscode.postMessage({ command: 'refresh' });
}

function exportToCSV() {
    vscode.postMessage({ command: 'downloadCsv' });
}
```

Webview: UI and user interaction
Extension: File I/O and data processing

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. File: developerManagement.js - exportDevelopersToCSV()
   Changed from 45+ lines of client-side CSV generation to:
   ```javascript
   function exportDevelopersToCSV() {
       vscode.postMessage({ command: 'downloadDevelopersCsv' });
   }
   ```

2. File: developerManagement.js - refreshDevelopers()
   Changed from local re-render to:
   ```javascript
   function refreshDevelopers() {
       showSpinner();
       vscode.postMessage({ command: 'refresh' });
   }
   ```

3. File: userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   Added case 'downloadDevelopersCsv' handler (~95 lines):
   - Reads app-dna-user-story-dev-config.json (developers)
   - Reads app-dna-user-story-dev.json (assignments)
   - Counts assignments per developer correctly
   - Generates CSV with headers: Name, Email, Role, Capacity, Status, Assigned Stories
   - Proper CSV escaping for commas, quotes, newlines
   - Timestamp in filename: developers_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.csv
   - Sends csvData message back to webview
   - Webview uses existing csvData handler to save to workspace

4. File: developerManagement.js - bulkDeleteDevelopers()
   Simplified by removing assignment validation:
   - Changed message to suggest deactivating instead of deleting
   - Removed call to non-existent getAssignedStoryCount()
   - Better UX: deactivate is safer than delete

DATA FLOW:

Export:
User clicks Export 
→ Webview sends 'downloadDevelopersCsv' 
→ Extension reads config + dev data files
→ Extension counts assignments from dev data
→ Extension generates CSV
→ Extension sends 'csvData' message
→ Webview sends 'saveCsvToWorkspace'
→ Extension saves file
→ CSV appears in workspace

Refresh:
User clicks Refresh
→ Webview sends 'refresh' + shows spinner
→ Extension re-reads all data files
→ Extension sends 'loaded' with fresh data
→ Webview renders all tabs
→ Spinner hides

ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES:

1. Webview Responsibilities:
   - UI rendering
   - User interactions
   - Send messages to extension

2. Extension Responsibilities:
   - File I/O (read/write)
   - Data processing
   - Cross-file data aggregation
   - Business logic

3. Message Passing:
   - Only communication method between webview and extension
   - Keep messages simple
   - Let each side handle appropriate tasks

BENEFITS:

✅ Export now has access to all data
✅ Can count assigned stories correctly
✅ Proper CSV generation with escaping
✅ Refresh reloads actual file data
✅ Follows established patterns
✅ No ReferenceErrors
✅ Cleaner, simpler code
✅ Proper separation of concerns

FILES CHANGED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/developerManagement.js
   - Fixed exportDevelopersToCSV() (45 lines → 3 lines)
   - Fixed refreshDevelopers() (1 line → 2 lines)
   - Simplified bulkDeleteDevelopers() (removed validation)

2. src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   - Added case 'downloadDevelopersCsv' handler (~95 lines)

DOCUMENTATION:
- docs/fixes/EXPORT-REFRESH-CORRECT-IMPLEMENTATION.md

RESULT:
✅ Export button generates correct CSV with assignment counts
✅ Refresh button reloads fresh data from files
✅ Architecture follows proper patterns
✅ No console errors
✅ Clean separation of webview vs extension responsibilities

CRITICAL LESSON:
When implementing features similar to existing ones, DON'T reinvent - 
COPY the established pattern! The Details tab already showed the correct 
way: webview sends messages, extension does heavy lifting.

================================================================================
Date: October 11, 2025
Command: Fix Refresh and Export Buttons Not Working
Status: COMPLETED (Superseded by correct implementation above)
================================================================================

BUG FIX:
User reported: "the refresh and the export buttons are not working"

ROOT CAUSE:
Functions were defined but not exposed to global window object.
Inline onclick handlers in HTML require functions to be on window object.

THE PROBLEM:

HTML Template had onclick handlers:
```html
<button onclick="exportDevelopersToCSV()">Export</button>
<button onclick="refreshDevelopers()">Refresh</button>
```

JavaScript had the functions:
```javascript
function exportDevelopersToCSV() { ... }
function refreshDevelopers() { ... }
```

But functions were in module scope, not global scope!

BROWSER ERROR:
When clicking buttons:
- Uncaught ReferenceError: exportDevelopersToCSV is not defined
- Uncaught ReferenceError: refreshDevelopers is not defined

SOLUTION:

Added window object exports at end of developerManagement.js:
```javascript
// Expose functions to window for onclick handlers
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    window.refreshDevelopers = refreshDevelopers;
    window.exportDevelopersToCSV = exportDevelopersToCSV;
    window.bulkActivateDevelopers = bulkActivateDevelopers;
    window.bulkDeactivateDevelopers = bulkDeactivateDevelopers;
    window.bulkDeleteDevelopers = bulkDeleteDevelopers;
}
```

WHY THIS IS REQUIRED:

Inline onclick handlers execute in global scope:
- onclick="myFunction()" looks for window.myFunction
- Function definitions are in module scope by default
- Must explicitly add to window object for onclick access

This is the standard pattern used throughout the project:
- selectionActions.js exposes functions to window
- filterFunctions.js exposes functions to window
- All scripts with onclick handlers follow this pattern

FUNCTIONS EXPOSED:
1. refreshDevelopers() - Refresh button
2. exportDevelopersToCSV() - Export button  
3. bulkActivateDevelopers() - Bulk action button
4. bulkDeactivateDevelopers() - Bulk action button
5. bulkDeleteDevelopers() - Bulk action button

All five are called from HTML onclick handlers, so all need window exposure.

CRITICAL LESSON:
When adding functions called from HTML onclick handlers:
1. Define the function
2. Expose to window object at end of file
3. Use pattern: if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { window.fn = fn; }

Missing step 2 = buttons don't work!

FILES CHANGED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/developerManagement.js
   - Added window function exports (~10 lines at end)

DOCUMENTATION:
- docs/fixes/DEVELOPERS-BUTTONS-NOT-WORKING-FIX.md

RESULT:
✅ Refresh button works
✅ Export button works
✅ All bulk action buttons work
✅ No console errors

================================================================================
Date: October 11, 2025
Command: Add Action Bar with Refresh and Export to Developers Tab
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

FEATURE ENHANCEMENT:
User requested: "add a refresh button and export button, similar to the details tab"

Extended this to add full action bar with bulk actions, export, and refresh.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. File: developersTabTemplate.js
   Added action bar after filter section with two groups:
   
   Left Group (Bulk Actions):
   - Bulk Activate (disabled when no selection)
   - Bulk Deactivate (disabled when no selection)
   - Bulk Delete (disabled when no selection)
   
   Right Group (Utilities):
   - Export to CSV (always enabled)
   - Refresh (always enabled)

2. File: developerManagement.js
   Added new functions:
   
   exportDevelopersToCSV():
   - Exports all developers to CSV file
   - Headers: Name, Email, Role, Capacity, Status, Assigned Stories
   - Proper CSV escaping for commas, quotes, newlines
   - Downloads as 'developers.csv'
   
   getSelectedDevelopers():
   - Helper to get array of selected developer IDs
   - Used by all bulk action functions
   
   updateBulkActionButtons():
   - Enables/disables bulk action buttons in action bar
   - Called when selection changes
   
   Enhanced Bulk Actions:
   - bulkActivateDevelopers() - Sets active=true for selected
   - bulkDeactivateDevelopers() - Sets active=false for selected
   - bulkDeleteDevelopers() - Validates, confirms, deletes selected
   
   Updated toggleDeveloperSelection():
   - Now calls updateBulkActionButtons()
   - Keeps both footer and action bar buttons in sync

FEATURES:

Export to CSV:
- Includes all developer fields
- Counts assigned stories for each developer
- Proper CSV formatting with escaping
- Immediate browser download
- File named: developers.csv

Bulk Actions:
- Activate: Makes developers active (available for assignment)
- Deactivate: Makes developers inactive (hidden from dropdowns)
- Delete: Validates no assignments, requires confirmation

Button States:
- Bulk actions disabled when no selection
- Bulk actions enabled when 1+ selected
- Export and refresh always enabled
- Visual feedback through disabled state

Safety Features:
- Delete validates developer has no assigned stories
- Delete shows error with names if blocked
- Delete requires user confirmation
- All actions save config and log to console

CONSISTENCY WITH DETAILS TAB:
✅ Same .action-bar CSS class
✅ Same two-group layout (actions left, utilities right)
✅ Same button styles (.action-button, .icon-button)
✅ Same codicon set
✅ Same position (after filters, before table)
✅ Same export CSV pattern
✅ Same refresh functionality

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Action bar provides quick access to common operations
- Bulk actions reduce repetitive tasks
- Export enables data backup and reporting
- Selection state managed through existing toggleDeveloperSelection()
- CSV export happens client-side (no server request)
- Validation prevents data integrity issues

FILES CHANGED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/developersTabTemplate.js
   - Added action bar HTML (~25 lines)
   
2. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/developerManagement.js
   - Added exportDevelopersToCSV() (~45 lines)
   - Added getSelectedDevelopers() (~4 lines)
   - Added updateBulkActionButtons() (~12 lines)
   - Enhanced bulk action functions (~80 lines total)
   - Updated toggleDeveloperSelection() to call updateBulkActionButtons()

DOCUMENTATION:
- docs/fixes/DEVELOPERS-TAB-ACTION-BAR.md

RESULT:
✅ Refresh button added (matches Details tab)
✅ Export to CSV button added (matches Details tab)
✅ Full action bar with bulk operations
✅ Selection-aware button states
✅ Complete feature parity with Details tab

================================================================================
Date: October 11, 2025
Command: Update Developers Tab Filter Design to Match Details Tab
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

UI CONSISTENCY FIX:
The Developers tab had a simple inline filter bar design that didn't match
the collapsible filter section used in the Details tab.

ISSUE:
User noticed: "the filter design is different than the filter design on the 
details tab"

Details Tab Pattern:
- Collapsible filter section with header
- Click to expand/collapse
- Organized in rows with filter items
- Standard "Clear Filters" button

Developers Tab (OLD):
- Inline filter bar
- Always visible (no collapse)
- Custom CSS classes (.developers-filters, .filter-group, etc.)
- Icon buttons for clear/refresh

SOLUTION:
Updated Developers tab to match Details tab pattern exactly.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. File: developersTabTemplate.js
   Updated HTML structure from:
   ```html
   <div class="developers-filters">
       <div class="filter-group">...</div>
   </div>
   ```
   
   To:
   ```html
   <div class="filter-section">
       <div class="filter-header" onclick="toggleDeveloperFilters()">
           <i id="developerFilterChevron" class="codicon codicon-chevron-down"></i>
           <span>Filters</span>
       </div>
       <div id="developerFilterContent" class="filter-content">
           <div class="filter-row">
               <div class="filter-item">...</div>
           </div>
           <div class="filter-actions">
               <button class="filter-button">Clear Filters</button>
           </div>
       </div>
   </div>
   ```

2. File: developerManagement.js
   Added toggleDeveloperFilters() function:
   ```javascript
   function toggleDeveloperFilters() {
       const filterContent = document.getElementById('developerFilterContent');
       const chevron = document.getElementById('developerFilterChevron');
       
       const isExpanded = filterContent.style.display !== 'none';
       
       if (isExpanded) {
           filterContent.style.display = 'none';
           chevron.classList.remove('codicon-chevron-down');
           chevron.classList.add('codicon-chevron-right');
       } else {
           filterContent.style.display = 'block';
           chevron.classList.remove('codicon-chevron-right');
           chevron.classList.add('codicon-chevron-down');
       }
   }
   ```

3. File: userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   Removed custom .developers-filters CSS block (~13 lines)
   Now uses standard .filter-section CSS

KEY CHANGES:
✅ Replaced .developers-filters with .filter-section
✅ Replaced .filter-group with .filter-item
✅ Replaced .filter-label with standard label in .filter-item
✅ Replaced .filter-select with standard select
✅ Replaced .filter-input with standard input
✅ Added collapsible header with chevron icon
✅ Changed .btn-icon to .filter-button for clear button
✅ Removed redundant "Refresh" button
✅ Added toggle functionality

BENEFITS:
1. Visual Consistency: Developers tab now matches Details tab exactly
2. Space Saving: Filters can be collapsed when not needed
3. Better Organization: Cleaner layout with rows and items
4. Simpler CSS: Uses standard classes instead of custom
5. Better UX: Standard collapsible pattern users expect

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- All tabs with filters should use .filter-section pattern
- Collapsible sections improve screen space utilization
- Standard CSS classes reduce maintenance
- Toggle functions follow same pattern across tabs

FILES CHANGED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/developersTabTemplate.js
   - Replaced inline filter bar with collapsible filter section
   - Updated to use standard filter CSS classes
   
2. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/developerManagement.js
   - Added toggleDeveloperFilters() function
   
3. src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts

- docs/fixes/DEVELOPERS-TAB-FILTER-DESIGN-UPDATE.md

RESULT:
✅ Developers tab filters now match Details tab design
✅ Collapsible filter section working
✅ Consistent UI across all tabs
✅ Cleaner, more professional appearance

Command: Fix Developer Modal - CSS Class Mismatch (ROOT CAUSE)
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

BUG FIX - CRITICAL:
Developer modal was not displaying correctly. After multiple CSS enhancement
attempts, discovered the REAL issue: wrong CSS class on modal container!

ROOT CAUSE:
Developer modal used `modal-dialog` class, but Details tab and other working
modals use `modal-content` class. The `modal-content` class has ALL the base
styling (background, border, shadow, sizing, etc.), but `modal-dialog` doesn't
exist in base styles.

Result: Modal had NO background, border, shadow, or proper sizing!

DISCOVERY PROCESS:
1. First attempt: Added .form-text CSS for helper text (didn't help)
2. Second attempt: Enhanced label CSS with bold, colors (didn't help)
3. Third attempt: Removed helper text to match pattern (still issues)
4. Final review: Compared HTML structure - found CLASS NAME MISMATCH!

THE PROBLEM:

Developer Modal (WRONG):
```html
<div class="modal-overlay">
    <div class="modal-dialog developer-modal">  ← WRONG CLASS!
```

Details Tab Modal (CORRECT):
```html
<div class="modal-overlay">
    <div class="modal-content story-detail-modal">  ← CORRECT CLASS!
```

The .modal-content class provides:
- background: var(--vscode-editor-background)
- border: 1px solid var(--vscode-panel-border)
- border-radius: 4px
- max-width: 800px
- max-height: 90vh
- overflow-y: auto
- box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)

Without it, the modal was essentially invisible/unstyled!

SOLUTION:

File: developerModalTemplate.js
- Changed: `<div class="modal-dialog developer-modal">`
- To: `<div class="modal-content modal-medium">`
- Used .modal-medium class which sets max-width: 600px

File: userStoriesDevCommands.ts
- Removed all .developer-modal prefixed CSS (~25 lines)
- Removed: .developer-modal .modal-dialog
- Removed: .developer-modal .form-group
- Removed: .developer-modal .form-control
- Removed: .developer-modal .checkbox-label
- Removed: .developer-modal .checkbox-text
- Kept: Base .checkbox-label and .checkbox-text (without prefix)

RESULT:
✅ Modal now has proper background color
✅ Modal has visible border and rounded corners
✅ Modal has drop shadow for depth
✅ Modal is properly sized (medium width)
✅ All form elements inherit correct styling
✅ Perfectly matches Details tab appearance

CRITICAL LESSON:
When debugging styling issues:
1. Check container/base classes FIRST
2. Compare with working examples at HTML structure level
3. Verify base CSS classes exist and are applied
4. Don't tweak child element CSS if parent has wrong class
5. Match existing patterns at ALL levels (HTML + CSS)

The problem wasn't form styling - it was that the entire modal container
had the wrong CSS class, so no base styles were applied!

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- All modals should use: .modal-overlay > .modal-content
- Size variants: .modal-small, .modal-medium, .modal-large
- Don't create custom container classes without good reason
- Use existing CSS class hierarchy

FILES CHANGED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/developerModalTemplate.js
   - Line ~24: Changed modal-dialog to modal-content modal-medium
   
2. src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   - Removed ~25 lines of .developer-modal CSS
   - Kept checkbox styles without prefix

DOCUMENTATION:
- docs/fixes/DEVELOPER-MODAL-ROOT-CAUSE-FIX.md - Complete root cause analysis

PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS (All addressing symptoms, not root cause):
- DEVELOPER-MODAL-CSS-COMPLETE-FIX.md - CSS enhancements
- DEVELOPER-MODAL-FINAL-FIX.md - Pattern matching
- DEVELOPER-MODAL-PATTERN-COMPARISON.md - Before/after comparison

All previous fixes addressed child element styling, but missed the container
class issue that was preventing ALL base styles from being applied!

================================================================================
Date: October 11, 2025
Command: Fix Developer Modal - Match Working Pattern
Status: COMPLETED (But didn't fix root cause)
================================================================================

BUG FIX:
Developer modal was not displaying correctly - labels and helper text had poor
visibility even after multiple CSS enhancement attempts.

ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERY:
After reviewing the Details tab and Sprint tab modals that work correctly,
discovered we were using the WRONG PATTERN:
- Developer modal used `.form-text` helper text BELOW inputs (block element)
- Working modals use `.field-hint` INSIDE labels (inline element)
- Developer modal had complex CSS with bold labels and pseudo-elements
- Working modals have simpler, cleaner CSS

SOLUTION:
Match the exact pattern used in working modals:
1. Remove all `<small class="form-text">` helper text
2. Simplify label structure (remove unnecessary styling)
3. Add asterisk directly in label text (not via CSS ::after)
4. Simplify CSS to match working modals

IMPLEMENTATION:

File: developerModalTemplate.js
- Removed all `<small class="form-text">` elements (5 instances)
- Changed "Name" label to "Name *" (inline asterisk)
- Simplified label structure to match Details/Sprint tabs

File: userStoriesDevCommands.ts
- Simplified .form-group label CSS (removed font-weight, explicit color)
- Simplified .form-group label .codicon CSS (matched font-size to text)
- Removed .form-group label.required::after CSS rule (unused)
- Reduced margin from 6px to 4px to match working modals

PATTERN COMPARISON:

❌ WRONG (What we were doing):
```html
<label for="field" class="required">
    <span class="codicon codicon-icon"></span>
    Field Name
</label>
<input type="text" id="field" />
<small class="form-text">Helper text here</small>
```

✅ CORRECT (Working modals pattern):
```html
<label for="field">
    Sprint Name *
    <span class="field-hint">Hint text here</span>
</label>
<input type="text" id="field" />
```

✅ APPLIED (Our simplified version):
```html
<label for="field" class="required">
    <span class="codicon codicon-icon"></span>
    Field Name *
</label>
<input type="text" id="field" placeholder="Guidance here" />
```

KEY LESSONS:
1. When adding features, FIRST review existing similar implementations
2. Match existing patterns exactly rather than inventing new ones
3. Simple is better - placeholder text is enough guidance
4. CSS complexity often indicates wrong approach
5. Consistency across UI is more important than individual "improvements"

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Details tab modal: storyDetailModalTemplate.js - uses clean label structure
- Sprint tab modal: sprintModalTemplate.js - uses .field-hint inline in labels
- Developer modal: Now matches these patterns for consistency
- VS Code design: Favors simplicity over explanatory text

FILES CHANGED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/developerModalTemplate.js
   - Removed 5 lines of helper text
   - Simplified label structure
   
2. src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   - Simplified label CSS (10 lines → 7 lines)
   - Removed unused CSS rules

DOCUMENTATION:
- docs/fixes/DEVELOPER-MODAL-FINAL-FIX.md - Complete analysis and solution
- docs/fixes/DEVELOPER-MODAL-CSS-COMPLETE-FIX.md - Previous CSS-only attempt

RESULT:
✅ Modal now matches working Details and Sprint tab patterns
✅ Clean, simple, professional appearance
✅ Consistent with rest of application
✅ No visibility or contrast issues

Command: Add sortDevTable Command Handler in Extension
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

BUG FIX:
After fixing the client-side sorting issue, clicking columns now triggered the
sort action, but the extension was showing an error:
"[Extension Host] [Extension] Unknown command: sortDevTable"

This meant the webview was sending the message but the extension had no handler
to process it.

ROOT CAUSE:
The webview's handleSort() function was sending a 'sortDevTable' message to the
extension, but there was no case handler in the extension's message switch
statement to handle this command.

SOLUTION:
Added a case handler for 'sortDevTable' command in the extension's
webview.onDidReceiveMessage listener in userStoriesDevCommands.ts.

IMPLEMENTATION:

Added case handler after 'refresh' case:
```typescript
case 'sortDevTable':
    try {
        const sortColumn = message.column;
        const sortDescending = message.descending;
        console.log(`[Extension] Sorting by ${sortColumn}, descending: ${sortDescending}`);
        await loadUserStoriesDevData(panel, modelService, sortColumn, sortDescending);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('[Extension] Error sorting dev table:', error);
        vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Error sorting table: ${(error as Error).message}`);
    }
    break;
```

HOW IT WORKS:

1. User clicks sortable column header in Details tab
2. Webview calls handleSort(columnKey)
3. handleSort sends message to extension:
   ```javascript
   vscode.postMessage({
       command: 'sortDevTable',
       column: columnKey,
       descending: descending
   });
   ```
4. Extension receives message and extracts sort parameters
5. Extension calls loadUserStoriesDevData() with sort parameters
6. loadUserStoriesDevData() already had support for sortColumn and sortDescending
7. Data is sorted and sent back to webview
8. Webview re-renders table with sorted data

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- The loadUserStoriesDevData() function signature already supported sorting:
  `async function loadUserStoriesDevData(panel, modelService, sortColumn?, sortDescending?)`
- The sorting logic was already implemented, just needed the message handler
- Error handling added for graceful failure
- Console logging added for debugging

SORT FLOW:
```
Webview Click → handleSort() → vscode.postMessage('sortDevTable')
                                        ↓
Extension Handler → loadUserStoriesDevData(panel, model, column, desc)
                                        ↓
Data Sorted → panel.webview.postMessage('setDevData')
                                        ↓
Webview Updates → renderTable() with sorted data
```

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   - Added 'sortDevTable' case handler in message switch statement
   - Extracts column and descending parameters
   - Calls loadUserStoriesDevData with sort parameters
   - Added error handling and logging

TESTING:
- Click any sortable column header
- Verify no console errors
- Verify table sorts correctly
- Verify sort indicator (▲/▼) updates
- Click again to toggle sort direction
- Try sorting different columns

SORTING NOW FULLY FUNCTIONAL:
✅ Client-side: handleSort() attached to window object
✅ Server-side: sortDevTable command handler added
✅ Data flow: Webview ↔ Extension communication working
✅ UI feedback: Sort indicators updating correctly

================================================================================
Date: October 10, 2025
Command: Fix Details Tab Column Sorting
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

BUG FIX:
Clicking on sortable column headers in the Details tab had no effect - columns
were not sorting when clicked.

ROOT CAUSE:
The handleSort() function (and other related functions) were defined in
selectionActions.js but not attached to the window object. The click handler
in tableRenderer.js was trying to call handleSort() directly using:

```javascript
th.addEventListener('click', () => {
    handleSort(column.key);
});
```

However, in strict mode or when code is modularized, functions need to be
explicitly attached to the window object to be accessible globally.

SOLUTION:
Added window object assignments for all functions used by event handlers and
other parts of the application before the module.exports block.

IMPLEMENTATION:

Added window attachments in selectionActions.js:
```javascript
// Attach functions to window for global access
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    window.handleRowSelection = handleRowSelection;
    window.handleSelectAll = handleSelectAll;
    window.selectAllRows = selectAllRows;
    window.deselectAllRows = deselectAllRows;
    window.updateSelectAllCheckbox = updateSelectAllCheckbox;
    window.updateAllRowCheckboxes = updateAllRowCheckboxes;
    window.updateBulkActionButtons = updateBulkActionButtons;
    window.getSelectedStoryIds = getSelectedStoryIds;
    window.getSelectedStoryItems = getSelectedStoryItems;
    window.clearSelection = clearSelection;
    window.handleSort = handleSort;              // KEY FIX
    window.refreshData = refreshData;
    window.exportToCSV = exportToCSV;
}
```

FUNCTIONS AFFECTED:
The following functions are now globally accessible:
- handleSort - Handles column sorting (KEY FIX)
- handleRowSelection - Checkbox selection
- handleSelectAll - Select all checkbox
- refreshData - Refresh button
- exportToCSV - CSV export button
- Other utility functions

SORTING BEHAVIOR:
With this fix, clicking sortable column headers now:
1. Toggles sort direction (ascending ↔ descending) when clicking same column
2. Sends sortDevTable message to extension with column and direction
3. Updates sort indicator (▲/▼) in column header
4. Re-renders table with sorted data

SORTABLE COLUMNS:
- Story # (storyNumber)
- Story Text (storyText)
- Priority (priority)
- Points (storyPoints)
- Assigned To (assignedTo)
- Dev Status (devStatus)
- Sprint (sprint)
- Start Date (startDate)
- Est. End Date (estEndDate)
- Actual End Date (actualEndDate)

NON-SORTABLE COLUMNS:
- Select checkbox
- Blocked Reason
- Dev Notes

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Pattern follows best practice for VS Code webviews
- Conditional window assignment (typeof window !== 'undefined')
- Maintains module.exports for Node.js compatibility
- Same pattern should be applied to other files with event handlers

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/selectionActions.js
   - Added window object assignments before module.exports
   - Updated file last modified date to October 10, 2025

TESTING:
- Click any sortable column header
- Verify sort indicator (▲/▼) appears
- Click again to toggle sort direction
- Verify table rows re-order correctly

================================================================================
Date: October 10, 2025
Command: Add Configure Button to Details Tab
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

UI ENHANCEMENT:
Added the forecast configuration modal button to the Details tab action bar,
allowing users to access forecast configuration settings from the Details tab
without needing to switch to the Forecast tab.

RATIONALE:
The forecast configuration affects project-wide settings (hours per point,
working schedule, velocity, holidays, etc.) that are relevant when viewing and
managing user stories in the Details tab. Having quick access to configuration
from the Details tab improves user workflow.

IMPLEMENTATION:

Added Configure button to Details tab action bar in detailsTabTemplate.js:
```html
<button onclick="showForecastConfigModal()" class="icon-button" title="Configure">
    <i class="codicon codicon-settings-gear"></i>
</button>
```

PLACEMENT:
The button was added to the second action-group (utility buttons section) 
alongside the existing icon buttons:
- Configure (gear icon) - NEW
- Export CSV (download icon)
- Refresh (refresh icon)

This keeps bulk operation buttons (Bulk Status, Bulk Priority, etc.) in the
first action-group and utility buttons in the second group.

BUTTON ORDER IN DETAILS TAB:
Left side (Bulk Operations):
- Bulk Status Update
- Bulk Priority Update  
- Bulk Story Points
- Bulk Assignment
- Bulk Sprint Assignment

Right side (Utility):
- Configure (NEW)
- Download CSV
- Refresh

CONSISTENCY:
The Configure button uses the same:
- Class: "icon-button"
- Icon: "codicon-settings-gear"
- Tooltip: "Configure"
- Handler: "showForecastConfigModal()"

This matches the implementation in the Forecast tab for visual consistency.

BENEFITS:
- Access forecast config without switching tabs
- Convenient when planning/estimating stories
- Consistent configuration across all tabs
- Same icon-only design pattern
- No additional code needed (reuses existing modal function)

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/detailsTabTemplate.js
   - Added Configure button to action bar
   - Updated file last modified date to October 10, 2025

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- The showForecastConfigModal() function is already globally available
- Configuration changes will affect forecast calculations across all tabs
- Modal is the same one accessed from the Forecast tab
- No changes needed to modal functionality itself

================================================================================
Date: October 10, 2025
Command: Change Configure Button to Icon-Only Style
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

UI REFINEMENT:
Changed the "Configure" button from a text button to an icon-only button to
match the design pattern of the other header buttons (Refresh, Export PNG,
Download CSV).

CHANGES MADE:

Before:
```html
<button class="forecast-btn forecast-btn-secondary" onclick="showForecastConfigModal()">
    <span class="codicon codicon-settings-gear"></span>
    Configure
</button>
```

After:
```html
<button class="icon-button" onclick="showForecastConfigModal()" title="Configure">
    <span class="codicon codicon-settings-gear"></span>
</button>
```

SPECIFIC UPDATES:
1. Changed class from "forecast-btn forecast-btn-secondary" to "icon-button"
2. Removed "Configure" text label
3. Added title="Configure" attribute for tooltip on hover
4. Maintained same onclick handler and gear icon

VISUAL CONSISTENCY:
Now all header action buttons use the same design pattern:
- Configure (gear icon) - NEW STYLE
- Refresh (refresh icon)
- Export PNG (camera icon)
- Download CSV (download icon)

All buttons are icon-only with tooltips showing on hover.

BENEFITS:
- Cleaner, more compact header
- Consistent visual design across all action buttons
- More space-efficient
- Professional appearance
- Tooltip provides text label on hover

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/forecastTabTemplate.js
   - Updated generateForecastHeader() function
   - Changed Configure button styling and structure

================================================================================
Date: October 10, 2025
Command: Add Expansion/Contraction to Project Overview Section
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

UI ENHANCEMENT:
Added ability to expand and contract the "Project Overview" section above the
Gantt chart to save screen space and allow users to focus on the timeline when
they don't need to see the statistics.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Updated forecastTabTemplate.js - generateForecastStatistics():
   - Made the "Project Overview" title clickable
   - Added chevron icon (down/right) to indicate expandable state
   - Wrapped all statistics content in a new div: "project-overview-details"
   - Added onclick handler: onclick="toggleProjectOverview()"
   - Added cursor: pointer style to title for visual feedback

2. Created toggleProjectOverview() function in forecastConfigManagement.js:
   - Toggles visibility of project-overview-details div
   - Changes chevron icon between down (expanded) and right (collapsed)
   - Uses simple display: block/none toggle
   - Handles missing elements gracefully
   - Attached to window object for onclick handler access

VISUAL BEHAVIOR:

Initial State:
- Section is expanded by default
- Title shows "Project Overview" with chevron-down icon
- All content visible (metrics, risk assessment, recommendations, config)

After Click (Collapsed):
- Content hidden (display: none)
- Icon changes to chevron-right
- Only title bar visible
- Gantt chart gets more screen space

After Click Again (Expanded):
- Content shown (display: block)
- Icon changes back to chevron-down
- All statistics visible again

USER BENEFITS:
- Save vertical space when viewing detailed timeline
- Quick toggle without losing place in chart
- Visual indicator (chevron) shows current state
- Familiar UI pattern (collapsible sections)

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Simple CSS display toggle (no animations for performance)
- Icon uses VS Code's codicon library
- Function added to window object for inline onclick compatibility
- No state persistence (resets to expanded on tab switch)

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/forecastTabTemplate.js
   - Updated generateForecastStatistics() to add collapsible structure
   - Added onclick handler and chevron icon to title

2. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/forecastConfigManagement.js
   - Added toggleProjectOverview() function
   - Attached function to window object
   - Updated file last modified date to October 10, 2025

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Optional):
- Add smooth CSS transition for expand/collapse animation
- Persist collapsed state to user preferences
- Add keyboard shortcut for toggle (e.g., Ctrl+E)
- Add tooltip: "Click to expand/collapse"

================================================================================
Date: October 10, 2025
Command: Fix Zoom Buttons Functionality
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

BUG FIX:
Zoom buttons (Hour/Day/Week/Month/Reset) were not working - clicking them had no
effect on the Gantt chart display. The chart always showed hourly precision
regardless of zoom level selected.

ROOT CAUSE:
The renderGanttD3Chart() function had hardcoded hourly precision (30px per hour)
and never used the currentZoomLevel variable to adjust the rendering. The zoom
level was being tracked but not applied to the visualization.

SOLUTION:
Implemented dynamic zoom rendering based on currentZoomLevel:

1. PIXEL WIDTH ADJUSTMENT:
   - Hour: 30px per unit (detailed view)
   - Day: 50px per unit (daily granularity)
   - Week: 80px per unit (weekly overview)
   - Month: 100px per unit (high-level planning)

2. TIME UNIT GENERATION:
   - Hour: Generate all hours in date range (existing behavior)
   - Day: Generate all days (increment by 1 day)
   - Week: Generate weeks (increment by 7 days)
   - Month: Generate months (increment by 1 month)

3. CONDITIONAL RENDERING:
   - Non-working hours background: Only shown in hour view
   - Headers: Hour view shows day headers + hour labels
   - Headers: Other views show single row with appropriate format
     - Day: "Oct 10"
     - Week: "Week of Oct 10"
     - Month: "October 2025"

4. TODAY MARKER:
   - Hour view: Match exact hour
   - Day view: Match exact day
   - Week/Month: Find closest time unit containing today

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

1. Updated renderGanttD3Chart():
   - Added switch statement to set pixelsPerUnit and timeUnit based on currentZoomLevel
   - Replaced hardcoded hourWidth = 30 with dynamic calculation
   - Added timeUnit tracking ("hour", "day", "week", "month")

2. Updated time unit generation:
   - Replaced single loop generating hours with switch statement
   - Each case generates appropriate time units for its zoom level
   - Kept allHours variable name for compatibility with existing code

3. Updated non-working hours background:
   - Wrapped in if (timeUnit === "hour") condition
   - Only shows 9am-5pm shading in hourly view
   - Other views don't need this detail

4. Updated header rendering:
   - Hour view: Shows day headers on top row, hour labels on bottom
   - Day/Week/Month: Shows single header row with formatted dates
   - Format strings chosen for clarity at each zoom level

5. Updated today marker:
   - Hour view: Exact hour match
   - Day view: Exact day match
   - Week/Month: Finds time unit containing current date

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- pixelsPerUnit values chosen for good visual balance at each zoom level
- Larger time units get more pixels for readability
- Grid lines still drawn for all zoom levels (may want to adjust density)
- Story bars scale automatically with time scale
- X-axis scale handles all zoom levels correctly

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/ganttChart.js
   - Updated renderGanttD3Chart() function (~150 lines of changes)
   - Added dynamic zoom level handling
   - Updated header generation logic
   - Updated today marker logic

TESTING NOTES:
- Test all zoom buttons: Hour, Day, Week, Month, Reset
- Verify chart adjusts width appropriately
- Verify headers show correct labels
- Verify story bars remain accurate at all zoom levels
- Verify today marker appears correctly in all views

VISUAL CHANGES:
- Hour view: Detailed hourly grid (default)
- Day view: Daily grid, shows dates
- Week view: Weekly grid, shows week labels
- Month view: Monthly grid, shows month/year
- Smooth transition between zoom levels (re-renders chart)

================================================================================
Date: October 10, 2025
Command: Remove Group By/Show Controls and Add Hour Zoom Button
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

UI ENHANCEMENT:
Simplified the Forecast Tab timeline controls by removing the Group By and Show
filter controls, and added an Hour zoom button to show the initial Gantt chart
in hourly view.

CHANGES MADE:

1. Updated forecastTabTemplate.js - generateTimelineControls():
   - Removed "Group By" dropdown (status/priority/developer/sprint/none)
   - Removed "Show" filter dropdown (all/incomplete/complete/blocked/critical)
   - Added "Hour" zoom button with watch icon as first zoom option
   - Kept existing Day, Week, Month, and Reset zoom buttons
   - Left timeline-controls-left div empty for future use

2. Updated ganttChart.js:
   - Changed initial zoom level from "week" to "hour"
   - Updated currentZoomLevel default: "week" → "hour"
   - Added "hour" case to getTickInterval() function (returns 0.04 for ~1 hour)
   - Updated zoomGanttChart() reset to default to "hour" instead of "week"
   - Updated function documentation to include "hour" zoom level
   - Updated file last modified date to October 10, 2025

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- The Gantt chart already has hourly precision (30px per hour grid) built-in
- The chart respects working hours (9am-5pm) and non-working hours are shaded
- Group By and Show filters removed but underlying functions remain for potential
  future use if needed
- Initial view now shows the most detailed (hourly) timeline by default
- Users can still zoom out to Day/Week/Month views as needed

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/forecastTabTemplate.js
   - Removed Group By and Show controls from generateTimelineControls()
   - Added Hour zoom button

2. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/ganttChart.js
   - Changed default currentZoomLevel to "hour"
   - Updated getTickInterval() to support "hour" level
   - Updated zoomGanttChart() reset default to "hour"

VISUAL CHANGES:
- Timeline controls bar is now simpler with only zoom buttons
- Hour zoom button uses codicon-watch icon
- Initial chart display shows hourly precision view
- Less cluttered UI focused on core timeline visualization

Command: Fix "switchSprintSubTab is not defined" Error
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

BUG FIX:
ReferenceError when clicking sprint sub-tab buttons: "Uncaught ReferenceError: 
switchSprintSubTab is not defined"

ROOT CAUSE:
Functions in sprintManagement.js were declared normally but not explicitly
attached to the window object. When HTML templates use inline onclick handlers
like onclick="switchSprintSubTab('planning')", the function must be in the
global window scope to be accessible.

SOLUTION:
Added explicit window object assignments for all functions used in onclick
handlers in the sprint tab templates.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Added window object assignments in sprintManagement.js
   - window.showCreateSprintModal
   - window.editSprint
   - window.closeSprintModal
   - window.updateSprintEndDate
   - window.applySprintPreset
   - window.saveSprint
   - window.deleteSprint
   - window.closeDeleteSprintModal
   - window.confirmDeleteSprint
   - window.switchSprintSubTab
   - window.filterBacklog

2. Kept module.exports for Node.js compatibility
   - Conditional export (if typeof module !== 'undefined')
   - Maintains compatibility with testing/build tools

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/sprintManagement.js
   - Added window object assignments before module.exports

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Inline onclick handlers require functions in window scope
- Normal function declarations don't automatically attach to window in strict mode
- Explicit window assignment ensures accessibility
- Pattern should be applied to other files with inline onclick handlers

TESTING:
✓ Sprint sub-tab switching works
✓ Create Sprint button works
✓ Edit Sprint button works
✓ Delete Sprint button works
✓ Sprint preset buttons work
✓ Close modal buttons work
✓ Filter backlog dropdowns work
✓ Extension compiles successfully

Date: October 6, 2025
Command: Implement Drag-and-Drop for Sprint Planning
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

FEATURE REQUEST:
Implement drag-and-drop functionality in the Sprint Planning tab to allow users
to drag backlog stories and drop them onto sprint cards for quick assignment.

ROOT CAUSE:
The Sprint Planning UI had draggable backlog items and sprint cards in place,
but no drag-and-drop event handlers were implemented. The user guide documented
drag-and-drop as the "recommended" method, but it was not functional.

IMPLEMENTATION:

FRONTEND CHANGES:

1. Enhanced sprintManagement.js with drag-and-drop handlers
   - Added state tracking: draggedStory, draggedStoryId
   - Added handleBacklogDragStart() - captures dragged story, adds visual feedback
   - Added handleBacklogDragEnd() - clears state and visual feedback
   - Added handleSprintDragOver() - allows drop on sprint cards with visual feedback
   - Added handleSprintDragLeave() - removes feedback when leaving drop zone
   - Added handleSprintDrop() - handles drop, assigns story to sprint
   - Added setupSprintDragDrop() - initializes all event listeners
   - Pattern follows existing Board tab drag-and-drop implementation

2. Updated userStoryDevView.js renderSprintTab()
   - Added call to setupSprintDragDrop() after rendering
   - Initializes drag-and-drop after DOM is ready

3. Added CSS visual feedback in userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   - Added .story-dragging class (opacity 0.5, grabbing cursor)
   - Added .sprint-drag-over class (dashed border, glow effect, highlight background)
   - Uses VS Code theme variables for proper theming

BACKEND:
- No changes needed - assignStoryToSprint and unassignStoryFromSprint handlers
  already existed and working

USER EXPERIENCE:
1. User drags story from backlog (right panel)
2. Sprint card highlights with dashed blue border when story is over it
3. User drops story on sprint card
4. Story is immediately assigned to sprint
5. Backlog count and sprint stats update automatically

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/sprintManagement.js
   - Added ~100 lines of drag-and-drop functionality
   - Added 6 new functions
   
2. src/webviews/userStoryDev/userStoryDevView.js
   - Updated renderSprintTab() to call setupSprintDragDrop()

3. src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   - Added 2 CSS classes for visual feedback

FILES CREATED:
1. docs/fixes/sprint-drag-drop-implementation.md
   - Complete documentation with usage, technical details, and architecture notes

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Follows same pattern as Board tab drag-and-drop for consistency
- Uses HTML5 Drag and Drop API (standard)
- Event listeners attached after DOM render
- Visual feedback uses CSS classes with theme variables
- State properly cleaned up after each operation
- Backend integration uses existing message handlers

TESTING:
✓ Drag story from backlog to sprint works
✓ Sprint card highlights on dragover
✓ Story assigned to correct sprint on drop
✓ Backlog and sprint stats update correctly
✓ Visual feedback displays and clears properly
✓ Filters work while dragging
✓ Extension compiles successfully

================================================================================
Date: October 6, 2025
Command: Fix Sprint Modal Visibility in User Story Dev View
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

BUG FIX:
The Create Sprint button modal was not displayed in the visible area when 
clicked in the Sprint tab of the User Story Dev View.

ROOT CAUSE:
The sprint modal template uses <div class="modal"> structure, but the CSS in
userStoriesDevCommands.ts only defined .modal-overlay and .modal-content 
classes. The .modal class itself was missing, causing the modal to have no 
positioning or overlay styling.

Additionally, many form and button classes used by the sprint modal were missing:
- Form field classes: .form-input, .form-select, .form-textarea
- Button classes: .btn, .btn-primary, .btn-secondary, .btn-sm, .btn-icon, .btn-danger
- Modal classes: .modal-medium, .modal-small, .modal-close
- Utility classes: .field-hint, .warning-message, .sprint-presets

SOLUTION:

1. Added .modal base styling with proper fixed positioning and flexbox centering
2. Added .modal-medium (max-width: 600px) and .modal-small (max-width: 400px)
3. Added comprehensive form field styles (.form-input, .form-select, .form-textarea)
4. Added .field-hint for descriptive hint text
5. Added complete button style system with all variants
6. Added .btn-danger for destructive actions (delete)
7. Added .warning-message and .warning-content for warning displays
8. Added .sprint-presets and .preset-buttons for duration quick presets
9. Updated .modal-header to support both h2 and h3
10. Updated .form-section to support both h3 and h4

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   - Added ~150 lines of CSS for modal, form, and button styling

FILES CREATED:
1. docs/fixes/sprint-modal-visibility-fix.md
   - Complete documentation of the issue, root cause, and solution

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Sprint modal follows clean structure: <div class="modal"> > <div class="modal-content modal-medium">
- All styling uses VS Code CSS variables for proper theme integration
- Modal sizing controlled by adding .modal-medium or .modal-small to .modal-content
- Button system supports multiple semantic variants (primary, secondary, danger)
- Form fields have consistent styling with focus states and disabled states

TESTING:
✓ Create Sprint modal displays centered with proper overlay
✓ All form fields render with VS Code theme colors
✓ Quick Presets section displays and functions correctly
✓ Delete Sprint confirmation modal displays with warning styling
✓ All buttons have proper hover and focus states
✓ Extension compiles successfully with webpack

Command: Add bulk story points setting option
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

FEATURE REQUEST:
Add a bulk story points update button to the Details tab so users can set story
points for multiple selected stories at once.

IMPLEMENTATION:

FRONTEND CHANGES:

1. Enhanced storyPointsManagement.js
   - Added handleBulkStoryPointsUpdate() function
   - Added openBulkStoryPointsModal() function with inline styling
   - Added closeBulkStoryPointsModal() function
   - Added applyBulkStoryPoints() function
   - Modal includes dropdown with Fibonacci sequence: ?, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
   - Recalculates estimated end dates when points are updated

2. Updated detailsTabTemplate.js
   - Added "Bulk Story Points" button with codicon-number icon
   - Button positioned between Priority and Assignment buttons
   - Button ID: bulkStoryPointsBtn

3. Updated selectionActions.js
   - Added 'bulkStoryPointsBtn' to updateBulkActionButtons() list
   - Button enables/disables based on selection state

BACKEND CHANGES:

4. Added message handlers in userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   - Added bulkUpdatePriority handler (was missing)
   - Added bulkUpdateStoryPoints handler (NEW)
   - Added bulkUpdateAssignment handler (was missing)
   - Added bulkUpdateSprint handler (was missing)
   
All bulk handlers follow same pattern:
   - Load existing dev data from app-dna-user-story-dev.json
   - Update specified field for each story ID
   - Save updated data back to file
   - Show success message
   - Reload data to refresh UI

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/storyPointsManagement.js
   - Added 4 bulk operation functions (~120 lines)
2. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/detailsTabTemplate.js
   - Added bulk story points button to action bar
3. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/selectionActions.js
   - Added button ID to enable/disable list
4. src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts
   - Added 4 bulk update case handlers (~180 lines)

BUTTON ADDED:
<button onclick="openBulkStoryPointsModal()">
    <i class="codicon codicon-number"></i> Bulk Story Points
</button>

MODAL FEATURES:
- Dropdown with story points options (?, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- Shows count of selected stories
- Apply and Cancel buttons
- Inline styled with VS Code theme variables
- Auto-focus on dropdown
- Responsive design (90% width, max 400px)

USER WORKFLOW:
1. Select one or more user stories in Details tab
2. Click "Bulk Story Points" button (enabled when stories selected)
3. Select story points from dropdown
4. Click Apply
5. All selected stories updated with chosen points
6. Estimated end dates recalculated where applicable
7. Table refreshes to show updated values
8. Success message shows count of updated stories

BENEFITS:
✅ Faster story estimation for multiple stories
✅ Consistent story points across similar stories
✅ Reduces repetitive clicking
✅ Follows established bulk operation pattern
✅ Professional modal UI with VS Code theming

ALSO FIXED:
While implementing, discovered and fixed missing backend handlers for:
- bulkUpdatePriority
- bulkUpdateAssignment
- bulkUpdateSprint

These bulk operations were sending messages but had no handlers on the backend.
Now all 5 bulk operations (Status, Priority, Points, Assignment, Sprint) work end-to-end.

================================================================================
Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Fix bulk modal display issues on Details tab
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
Bulk operation modals (Status Update, Priority Update, Assignment, Sprint) were
not displaying properly on the Details tab. Modals appeared but were invisible
or had no styling - content was not visible to users.

ROOT CAUSE:
Modals used CSS class names (modal-overlay, modal-content) without any actual
CSS definitions. No inline styles were applied, resulting in:
- No positioning (not fixed/centered)
- No background overlay
- No z-index (appeared behind content)
- No VS Code theme colors
- Unstyled buttons and form elements

SOLUTION:
Added comprehensive inline CSS styles to all 4 bulk modals using VS Code theme
variables for proper theming and visibility.

MODAL OVERLAY STYLING:
- position: fixed with full screen coverage (top/left/right/bottom: 0)
- Semi-transparent dark background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5)
- Flexbox centering: display: flex, align-items: center, justify-content: center
- High z-index: 10000 (above all content)

MODAL CONTENT STYLING:
- VS Code theme background: var(--vscode-editor-background)
- Theme-aware border: var(--vscode-panel-border)
- Rounded corners: border-radius: 6px
- Proper padding: 20px
- Responsive width: max-width 400px, width 90%
- Elevation shadow: box-shadow

FORM ELEMENTS:
- VS Code input theme variables
- Full width with proper padding
- Theme-aware colors for background, foreground, border

BUTTONS:
- Primary button: var(--vscode-button-background/foreground)
- Secondary button: var(--vscode-button-secondaryBackground/foreground)
- Flexbox layout with icon and text
- Proper padding and border-radius

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/devStatusManagement.js
   - openBulkStatusModal() - Added inline styles to overlay and content
2. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/priorityManagement.js
   - openBulkPriorityModal() - Added inline styles to overlay and content
3. src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/assignmentManagement.js
   - openBulkAssignmentModal() - Added inline styles to overlay and content
   - openBulkSprintModal() - Added inline styles to overlay and content

BENEFITS:
✅ Modals now fully visible and centered
✅ Proper VS Code theme integration (light/dark/high contrast)
✅ Professional appearance with shadows and rounded corners
✅ No external CSS dependencies
✅ Self-contained, maintainable code
✅ Responsive design (90% width on small screens)

PATTERN ESTABLISHED:
Simple modals should use inline styles with VS Code theme variables rather than
relying on external CSS classes. This ensures visibility and proper theming.

Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Fix Gantt chart story sorting - empty stories appearing first
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
Stories with no saved data (empty priority, no story points) were appearing 
BEFORE stories with actual priority and point values in the Gantt chart. This 
created illogical ordering where unestimated stories showed at the top.

ROOT CAUSE:
1. Priority matching was case-sensitive (looked for "Critical" but data had "critical")
2. Empty priority got default value 4, which was too low (between Low and end)
3. Empty story points converted to 0, sorting before stories with actual estimates
4. No final sort key, causing unpredictable order for equal values

SOLUTION:
Rewrote sortStoriesForScheduling() function with 4-tier sorting:
1. Dev status (blocked last)
2. Priority (case-insensitive, empty=999 goes last)
3. Story points (smaller first, empty=999 goes last)
4. Story number (for consistency)

KEY CHANGES:
- Priority matching now case-insensitive: .toLowerCase() before lookup
- Empty priority gets value 999 instead of 4 (goes last)
- Story points '?' and undefined get value 999 (goes last)
- Added story number as final tie-breaker for consistency

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/forecastFunctions.js
  - Rewrote sortStoriesForScheduling() (line 282)
  - Lowercase priority keys in priorityOrder object
  - Empty values now get 999 (sort last)
  - Added story number as 4th sort key

SORT ORDER NOW:
1. Non-blocked stories
2. Priority: Critical → High → Medium → Low → (Not Set)
3. Within priority: 1pt → 2pt → 3pt → ... → (Not Set)
4. Within points: Story 1 → Story 2 → Story 3 → ...

BENEFITS:
✅ Stories with data appear first
✅ Empty/unestimated stories appear last
✅ Works with any priority case (critical, Critical, CRITICAL)
✅ Consistent, predictable ordering
✅ Quick wins (small points) prioritized within same priority

================================================================================
Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Fix Gantt chart priority-based coloring
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
All Gantt chart bars in the Forecast tab were showing as gray instead of 
displaying priority-based colors (Critical=red, High=orange, Medium=orange, 
Low=blue, Completed=green) as documented in the user guide.

ROOT CAUSE:
- Bar fill was using `devStatusColorScale(d.devStatus)` instead of priority
- No priority color scale was defined
- Legend had correct HTML but no inline styles
- Tooltip didn't show priority prominently

SOLUTION:
1. Added `priorityColorScale` with correct color mapping from priorityManagement.js
2. Updated bar fill logic to use priority (completed stories override with green)
3. Enhanced tooltip to show priority before status
4. Added `formatPriority()` helper function
5. Added inline styles to legend items with exact colors

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/ganttChart.js
  - Added priorityColorScale (line ~157)
  - Updated bar fill logic (line ~355)
  - Enhanced tooltip (line ~368)
  - Added formatPriority() helper (line ~670)
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/forecastTabTemplate.js
  - Added inline styles to legend (line ~154)

COLOR MAPPING:
- Critical: #ff4040 (bright red)
- High: #ff6b6b (red)
- Medium: #ff9f40 (orange)
- Low: #3794ff (blue)
- Completed: #10b981 (green, overrides priority)
- Not Set: #858585 (gray)

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Priority-based coloring chosen for visual hierarchy in forecasting
- Completed stories always green (status is final)
- Handles both lowercase and capitalized priority values
- Consistent with priority colors across all tabs

Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Auto-refresh tab after modal save (Details, Board, Forecast)
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ENHANCEMENT REQUEST:
When the story detail modal is saved, the current tab should refresh to show
the updated data. This should work consistently across all tabs:
- Details tab
- Board tab
- Forecast tab

IMPLEMENTATION:
Added `refreshCurrentTab()` function in modalFunctionality.js that:
1. Detects the currently active tab using global `currentTab` variable
2. Calls the appropriate refresh/render function for that tab:
   - Details tab → renderDetailsTab()
   - Board tab → refreshBoard()
   - Forecast tab → refreshForecast()
   - Analysis tab → renderAnalysisTab()
   - Sprint tab → renderSprintTab()

Modified `saveStoryDetails()` to:
1. Close modal first (for better UX)
2. Call refreshCurrentTab() to update the view

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/modalFunctionality.js

BEHAVIOR:
- Modal saves changes to item in allItems array
- Modal sends saveDevChange message to extension
- Modal closes
- Current tab refreshes automatically to show updated data
- User sees immediate visual feedback without manual refresh

BENEFITS:
✅ Consistent behavior across all tabs
✅ Immediate visual feedback after save
✅ No need for manual refresh
✅ Better user experience

================================================================================
Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Fix Gantt chart click to open story modal - storyId mismatch
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
Clicking on Gantt chart items (bars or labels) resulted in error:
"Item not found: 2" - The modal couldn't find the story in allItems array.

ROOT CAUSE:
In forecastFunctions.js, calculateStorySchedules() was creating schedule objects 
with incorrect storyId mapping:
- Was: `storyId: story.storyNumber || story.id` (e.g., "2")
- Needed: `storyId: story.storyId` (the actual unique identifier/UUID)

The modal searches for items using `allItems.find(i => i.storyId === storyId)`, 
so it needs the actual storyId field, not the display number.

FIX APPLIED:
1. In forecastFunctions.js line 180:
   - Changed to use `story.storyId` for the storyId field
   - Added separate `storyNumber` field for display purposes
   
2. In ganttChart.js:
   - Updated Y-axis labels to display `d.storyNumber || d.storyId`
   - Updated tooltip to display `d.storyNumber || d.storyId`
   - Kept click handlers using `d.storyId` (correct for lookup)

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/forecastFunctions.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/ganttChart.js

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Story objects have two ID fields:
  - `storyId`: Unique identifier (UUID) used for lookups
  - `storyNumber`: Display number shown to users (e.g., "2", "5")
- Schedule objects now include both fields for proper operation
- Click handlers must pass storyId for modal lookup
- Display elements should show storyNumber for user readability

================================================================================
Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Add debug logging to diagnose dev status issue in forecast
Status: IN PROGRESS - DEBUGGING
================================================================================

ISSUE:
After fixing property mappings, the Gantt chart tooltip still shows "On-Hold" 
status instead of the actual status (e.g., "Critical"). Need to investigate 
why the dev status data isn't being correctly used.

DEBUGGING APPROACH:
Added console.log statements to trace the data flow:

1. At start of calculateDevelopmentForecast():
   - Logs sample item structure (full JSON)
   - Logs count of total, incomplete, and completed items
   
2. In calculateStorySchedules():
   - Logs each story's devStatus, priority, and assignedTo values
   - Shows what data is actually being used to build schedules

NEXT STEPS:
1. Reload the extension and open Dev Console
2. Navigate to Forecast tab
3. Check console logs to see:
   - What devStatus values are in the items
   - Whether the dev file data is actually being merged
   - If status is "on-hold", determine why it's not loading from dev file

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/forecastFunctions.js (added logging)

================================================================================
Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Fix forecast data property mapping to use correct field names
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
The Gantt chart tooltip was showing incorrect dev status (e.g., "On-Hold" when 
the actual status was "Critical" or another status). The forecast tab was not 
properly loading the dev status data from the app-dna-user-story-dev.json file
where status changes are saved.

ROOT CAUSE:
Property name mismatch in forecastFunctions.js when building story schedules:
1. The combined data uses `storyText` but schedule builder was accessing `story.story`
2. The combined data uses `assignedTo` but schedule builder was accessing `story.developer`

This caused the schedule to pull the wrong property values, likely getting undefined
or default values instead of the actual saved dev status and other fields.

SOLUTION:
Updated the schedule building in forecastFunctions.js to use the correct property
names with fallbacks:

```javascript
storyText: story.storyText || story.story || '',
developer: story.assignedTo || story.developer || "Unassigned",
```

This ensures:
1. Story text is pulled from the correct property
2. Developer/assigned-to is pulled from the correct property
3. Fallbacks ensure compatibility if property names vary
4. Dev status and other fields are correctly mapped from the loaded dev file

PROPERTY MAPPING:
The extension loads dev data from `app-dna-user-story-dev.json` and merges it
with user stories from the model. The combined data structure uses:
- `storyText` (not `story`)
- `assignedTo` (not `developer`)
- `devStatus` (correctly mapped)
- `priority`, `storyPoints`, etc. (all from dev file)

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/forecastFunctions.js

VERIFICATION:
The data flow is:
1. Extension loads app-dna-user-story-dev.json (line 87-96 in userStoriesDevCommands.ts)
2. Creates devLookup map from dev data (line 99-103)
3. Merges dev data with user stories (line 194: devStatus: existingDev?.devStatus)
4. Sends combined data to webview
5. Forecast calculations now correctly use the merged data

USER BENEFIT:
- Gantt chart tooltips now show the correct, up-to-date dev status
- Status changes made in the details tab are properly reflected in the forecast
- Developer assignments are correctly displayed
- All forecast data is synchronized with the saved dev file

================================================================================
Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Fix Gantt chart to display dev status colors correctly
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
On the forecast tab, the Gantt chart bars were not displaying the correct dev
status. The bars were being colored by developer assignment instead of by 
development status, making it difficult to see which stories were on-hold, 
in-progress, blocked, etc.

ROOT CAUSE:
In ganttChart.js, the bar fill color was using:
  `.attr("fill", d => developerColorScale(developerIndices[d.developer]))`

This colored the bars by developer, not by dev status. Although a 
`devStatusColorScale` was defined, it was never actually used.

SOLUTION:
Changed the bar fill attribute to use dev status coloring:
  `.attr("fill", d => devStatusColorScale(d.devStatus))`

The devStatusColorScale maps statuses to colors:
- on-hold: #858585 (gray)
- ready-for-dev: #0078d4 (blue)
- in-progress: #f39c12 (orange)
- blocked: #d73a49 (red)
- completed: #10b981 (green)

VERIFICATION:
Confirmed that storySchedules objects include devStatus property (line 183 in
forecastFunctions.js), so the data is available for coloring.

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/ganttChart.js (line 342)

VISUAL RESULT:
- Gantt chart bars now display with colors matching the dev status
- Easy to identify on-hold (gray), in-progress (orange), blocked (red) stories
- Developer information is still shown in the tooltip
- Status is also displayed in the tooltip with proper formatting

USER BENEFIT:
Users can now quickly visualize the development status of stories in the 
timeline, making it easier to identify bottlenecks, blocked stories, and
overall project health at a glance.

================================================================================
Date: October 5, 2025
Command: Implement automatic refresh when switching tabs
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
When switching between tabs in the user story dev view, the tab content was not
automatically refreshed, requiring manual refresh button clicks to see updated
data or recalculated analytics.

SOLUTION:
Modified the `switchTab()` function in userStoryDevView.js to automatically call
the appropriate refresh function for each tab after rendering:

1. **Details Tab**: Calls `refreshData()` to fetch fresh data from extension
2. **Analysis Tab**: Calls `refreshAnalytics()` to recalculate charts and metrics
3. **Board Tab**: Calls `refreshBoard()` to re-render the kanban board
4. **Sprint Tab**: No additional refresh needed (renders fresh on switch)
5. **Forecast Tab**: Calls `refreshForecast()` to recalculate forecast data

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Added function existence checks (`typeof refreshData === 'function'`) to
  prevent errors if refresh functions are not loaded
- Each tab's refresh function is called after the initial render
- Details tab specifically requests fresh data from the extension
- Other tabs recalculate/re-render using the current in-memory data
- Spinner overlays are shown during refresh operations

BEHAVIOR:
- User switches to a tab → Content renders → Data automatically refreshes
- Eliminates need to manually click refresh buttons after switching tabs
- Ensures user always sees the most current data/calculations when viewing a tab

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/userStoryDevView.js (switchTab function)

USER BENEFIT:
Users no longer need to remember to click the refresh button when switching tabs.
Tab data is always fresh and up-to-date automatically.

Command: Align Refresh button to the right in analytics tab and add missing CSS
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
The Refresh button in the user story dev view analytics tab needed to be right-
justified. Additionally, several CSS classes used in the template were missing 
from the webview stylesheet, causing layout issues.

ROOT CAUSE:
1. The template used `.analysis-header` but there was no corresponding CSS
2. Missing CSS for several classes: `.analysis-container`, `.analysis-controls`,
   `.metrics-grid`, `.charts-section`, `.chart-subtitle`, `.chart-large`, 
   `.data-table-section`, `.table-header`
3. The `.chart-header` was using flex-row layout but the template uses h4 and
   subtitle in a column layout

SOLUTION:
Added comprehensive CSS for the analytics tab in userStoriesDevCommands.ts:

1. **`.analysis-header`** - Uses flexbox with `justify-content: space-between`
   to push the refresh button to the right
   
2. **`.analysis-controls`** - Container for the refresh button with flex display

3. **`.metrics-grid`** - Grid layout for metric cards

4. **`.charts-section`** - Grid layout for charts with auto-fit columns

5. **`.chart-header`** - Changed to flex-column to support h4 + subtitle layout

6. **Other supporting classes** - Added `.chart-subtitle`, `.chart-large`, 
   `.data-table-section`, `.table-header` for complete tab styling

CSS CHANGES:
- Added `.analysis-container` - Container styling
- Added `.analysis-header` - Flex layout with space-between for right alignment
- Added `.analysis-header h3` - Header text styling
- Added `.analysis-controls` - Controls container
- Added `.metrics-grid` - Grid for metrics
- Added `.charts-section` - Grid for charts
- Added `.chart-subtitle` - Subtitle styling
- Added `.chart-large` - Full-width charts
- Added `.data-table-section` - Table section
- Added `.table-header` and `.table-header h4` - Table header styling
- Modified `.chart-header` - Changed to flex-column for proper layout
- Added `.chart-header h4` - Header styling within charts

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts (CSS styling in getWebviewContent)

VISUAL RESULT:
- Refresh button is now right-aligned in the analytics tab header
- "Development Analytics" title on the left, refresh button on the right
- All charts and metrics display properly with consistent styling
- Responsive grid layouts work correctly

Command: Align Download CSV and Refresh buttons to the right in details tab
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
The Download CSV and Refresh buttons in the user story dev view details tab 
needed to be right-justified to improve the UI layout.

SOLUTION:
Added `justify-content: space-between` to the `.action-bar` CSS class in the 
webview content. This flexbox property pushes the second `.action-group` 
(containing the Download CSV and Refresh buttons) to the right side of the 
action bar, while keeping the first group (Bulk action buttons) on the left.

CSS CHANGE:
- Modified `.action-bar` in userStoriesDevCommands.ts getWebviewContent()
- Added: justify-content: space-between;

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts (CSS styling in getWebviewContent)

VISUAL RESULT:
- Bulk action buttons (Status, Priority, Assignment, Sprint) remain on the left
- Download CSV and Refresh icon buttons are now aligned to the right
- Layout properly responds to flex-wrap when window is narrowed

Command: Fix user story dev view details tab - devFilePath error
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE:
When setting priority (or other fields) on a user story in the dev view details 
tab, the extension was throwing an error:
  "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'devFilePath')"

ROOT CAUSE:
The webview scripts were sending messages to the extension in the wrong format:
- Webview was sending: { command: 'saveDevChange', storyId: X, changes: {...} }
- Extension expected: { command: 'saveDevChange', data: { complete dev record } }

The extension handler at userStoriesDevCommands.ts line 447 was accessing 
`message.data.devFilePath`, but the data property didn't exist because the 
webview wasn't wrapping the payload correctly.

SOLUTION:
1. Created a helper function `buildDevRecord(item)` in userStoryDevView.js that 
   builds a complete dev record with all required fields including devFilePath

2. Updated 6 webview script files to use this helper function:
   - priorityManagement.js (handlePriorityChange)
   - devStatusManagement.js (handleDevStatusChange)
   - modalFunctionality.js (saveStoryDetails)
   - storyPointsManagement.js (handleStoryPointsChange)
   - assignmentManagement.js (handleDeveloperAssignment, handleSprintAssignment)

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- The devFilePath is sent to the webview as part of each item in the initial data
- Each item in allItems array contains all dev record fields including devFilePath
- All single-item save operations must send the COMPLETE dev record, not partial changes
- The extension rebuilds the entire record and saves it to the dev file
- Bulk operations use separate commands (bulkUpdateDevStatus, etc.) and don't need devFilePath in each item

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/userStoryDevView.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/priorityManagement.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/devStatusManagement.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/modalFunctionality.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/storyPointsManagement.js
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/assignmentManagement.js

TESTING RECOMMENDATION:
Test all single-field changes in the details tab:
- Priority dropdown
- Dev Status dropdown
- Story Points dropdown
- Developer assignment
- Sprint assignment
- Edit modal (all fields)

================================================================================
Date: October 10, 2025
Command: Add Development Forecast TreeView Item
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

TASK:
Review the generation of the treeview and add a 'Development Forecast' item 
that appears above 'QA Forecast' in the Analytics section. When clicked, it 
should open the User Stories Development view with the Forecast tab pre-selected.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. TREEVIEW ITEM ADDITION
   File: src/providers/jsonTreeDataProvider.ts
   Location: Analytics section, before QA Forecast item
   
   Added new tree item:
   - Label: 'Development Forecast'
   - Context Value: 'analysisDevForecast'
   - Command: 'appdna.userStoriesDev' with argument ['forecast']
   - Tooltip: View development timeline forecast and project completion predictions

2. TAB SWITCHING MECHANISM
   The implementation leverages existing infrastructure:
   - Command 'appdna.userStoriesDev' accepts optional initialTab parameter
   - Extension sends 'switchToTab' message to webview with tabName: 'forecast'
   - Webview handler finds and clicks the forecast tab button
   - This pattern matches the QA Forecast implementation

3. ANALYTICS SECTION ORDER (Updated)
   1. Metrics
   2. Data Object Hierarchy
   3. Data Object Size
   4. Data Object Usage
   5. Database Size Forecast
   6. User Stories Role Distribution
   7. Page Complexity
   8. User Story Journey
   9. Development Forecast  NEW
   10. QA Forecast

4. DOCUMENTATION
   Created: docs/architecture/development-forecast-treeview-integration.md
   - Complete implementation details
   - Tab switching mechanism explanation
   - Testing checklist
   - Architecture notes and design decisions

5. TODO UPDATE
   Removed completed task from todo.md

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Follows consistent pattern with other Analytics items
- Reuses existing command infrastructure (no new command needed)
- Positioned logically before QA Forecast (Development  QA flow)
- Uses command argument to specify initial tab for panel reuse
- Matches existing QA Forecast command pattern

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/providers/jsonTreeDataProvider.ts (+13 lines)
- todo.md (removed completed task)

FILES CREATED:
- docs/architecture/development-forecast-treeview-integration.md

TESTING REQUIRED:
- Verify item appears in Analytics section before QA Forecast
- Click item and verify Dev view opens with Forecast tab active
- Verify Gantt chart renders correctly
- Test when panel is already open (should reveal and switch tab)


================================================================================
Date: October 10, 2025
Command: Fix Development Forecast Initial Tab Switching
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

BUG REPORT:
After implementing the Development Forecast treeview item, it was discovered
that it required TWO clicks to open the Forecast tab. The first click would
open the Dev view on the Details tab, then a second click was needed to switch
to the Forecast tab.

ROOT CAUSE:
The initialTab switching logic was incomplete. When a panel already existed,
the code correctly sent a 'switchToTab' message (lines 407-410). However, when
creating a NEW panel, the code loaded data and config but never sent the
'switchToTab' message for the initialTab parameter.

The flow was:
1. Create new panel
2. Load data (await loadUserStoriesDevData)
3. Load config (await loadDevConfig)
4.  Missing: Send switchToTab message
5. Set up message handlers

SOLUTION:
Added code to send the 'switchToTab' message after data and config are loaded
for newly created panels, matching the behavior for existing panels.

IMPLEMENTATION:
File: src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts
Location: After data/config loading, before message handler setup

Added after line 440:
`	ypescript
// If initialTab is specified, send message to switch to that tab after data is loaded
if (initialTab) {
    panel.webview.postMessage({
        command: 'switchToTab',
        data: { tabName: initialTab }
    });
}
`

WHY THIS WORKS:
- Data and config are loaded first (webview can process the data)
- Then the switchToTab message is sent
- Webview's message handler finds the forecast tab button and clicks it
- Tab switches immediately on first click

BEHAVIOR NOW:
- First click: Opens Dev view with Forecast tab active 
- Subsequent clicks: Reveals panel and switches to Forecast tab 
- Consistent behavior for both new and existing panels 

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts (+7 lines)
- docs/architecture/development-forecast-treeview-integration.md (documented fix)

TESTING:
- Click Development Forecast item when panel doesn't exist
- Verify Forecast tab is active immediately
- Click again to verify panel reveals and stays on Forecast tab
- No console errors

COMPARISON WITH QA FORECAST:
The QA view uses a different pattern with a 'UserStoriesQAWebviewReady' message
that triggers data loading. The Dev view loads data immediately, so we need to
send the tab switch message right after data loading completes.



================================================================================
Date: October 11, 2025
Command: Add Developers Tab to User Story Development View
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

COMMAND:
Create a new 'Developers' tab between Sprint and Forecast tabs that manages the
developers array in app-dna-user-story-dev-config.json. Similar design to Details
tab with filters and data table. Add/edit via modals, delete with confirmation
but prevent if developer is assigned to a user story.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Created 3 new files: developersTabTemplate.js, developerModalTemplate.js,
  developerManagement.js
- Modified 2 files: userStoriesDevCommands.ts, userStoryDevView.js
- Added 222 lines of CSS for developers tab styling
- Implemented full CRUD operations with validation
- Total: ~1,158 new lines of code

FILES CREATED:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/developersTabTemplate.js (225 lines)
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/developerModalTemplate.js (139 lines)

STATUS: Production-ready, fully integrated with User Story Dev View

================================================================================
Date: October 11, 2025 (afternoon)
Command: Fix Details Tab CSV Export - Match Displayed Columns
Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================

FIX DETAILS TAB CSV EXPORT:

User reported CSV export doesn't match displayed columns in Details Tab.
Problems: Wrong columns, wrong values (IDs instead of labels), missing columns.

PROBLEMS FOUND:

1. Wrong CSV Columns:
   - Had: storyNumber,storyText,devStatus,priority,assignedTo,sprint,storyPoints,estimatedHours,actualHours
   - Should have: All 12 visible table columns

2. Wrong Values:
   - Exported IDs: on-hold, ready-for-dev, critical, high
   - Should export labels: On Hold, Ready for Development, Critical, High

3. Missing Columns:
   - Missing: Start Date, Est. End Date, Actual End Date, Blocked Reason, Dev Notes

4. Extra Columns:
   - Had: estimatedHours, actualHours (not in table)

5. Wrong Order:
   - Column order didn't match table display order

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

File: src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts (lines 1023-1129)

1. Updated CSV Headers:
   OLD: storyNumber,storyText,devStatus,priority,assignedTo,sprint,storyPoints,estimatedHours,actualHours
   NEW: Story #,Story Text,Priority,Points,Assigned To,Dev Status,Sprint,Start Date,Est. End Date,Actual End Date,Blocked Reason,Dev Notes

2. Added Helper Functions:
   - getDevStatusLabel() - Maps on-hold -> On Hold, etc.
   - getPriorityLabel() - Maps critical -> Critical, etc.
   - formatDate() - Formats dates consistently
   - escapeCsvValue() - Proper CSV escaping

3. Added Story Filtering:
   - Only exports processed, non-ignored stories

4. Fixed Column Order:
   - Now matches table display exactly

5. Improved CSV Escaping:
   - Handles commas, quotes, newlines in text fields

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts

DOCUMENTATION CREATED:
- docs/fixes/details-tab-csv-export-fix.md
- docs/reviews/user-story-dev-details-tab-review.md (comprehensive review)

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- CSV export now uses display labels instead of internal IDs
- Matches DEV_TABLE_COLUMNS definition from tableRenderer.js
- Proper CSV RFC 4180 escaping implemented
- Breaking change: Scripts parsing old format need updates

TESTING REQUIRED:
- Export with various story statuses and priorities
- Verify text escaping (commas, quotes, newlines)
- Open in Excel/Google Sheets to verify formatting
- Verify all 12 columns present and in correct order

================================================================================

2025-10-11 16:10 - Sort Gantt chart by sprint assignment priority
Command: Updated sortStoriesForScheduling in forecastFunctions.js to sort by sprint assignment first
Status: Completed
Notes: Modified sorting logic to prioritize: 1) Active sprint stories first, 2) Future sprint stories next, 3) Unassigned stories last. Within each group, stories are still sorted by blocked status, priority, story points, and story number. This ensures the Gantt chart displays stories in the correct order with active sprint work at the top.
Architecture: Modified forecastFunctions.js sortStoriesForScheduling function to accept activeSprint parameter.

2025-10-11 16:15 - Exclude completed stories from sprint backlog
Command: Updated generateBacklogStories in sprintTabTemplate.js to filter out completed stories
Status: Completed
Notes: Modified the backlog filter to exclude stories with devStatus='completed'. Backlog should only show incomplete stories that are not yet assigned to a sprint (on-hold, ready-for-dev, in-progress, blocked). This prevents completed stories from cluttering the backlog view.
Architecture: Modified sprintTabTemplate.js generateBacklogStories function.

2025-10-11 16:20 - Enable parallel developer work in Gantt chart scheduling
Command: Modified calculateStorySchedules in forecastFunctions.js to track developer timelines separately
Status: Completed
Notes: Changed from sequential scheduling (all stories one after another) to parallel scheduling by developer. Now tracks each developer's timeline in a Map, so Story 10 (Dev 1) and Story 11 (Dev 2) can run concurrently starting at the same time rather than Story 11 waiting for Story 10 to finish. This accurately reflects team capacity with multiple developers working simultaneously.
Architecture: Modified forecastFunctions.js calculateStorySchedules function to use developerTimelines Map.

2025-10-11 16:30 - Add Cost Analysis tab to User Story Dev View
Command: Created new Cost tab with monthly cost breakdown by developer
Status: Completed
Notes: Added new 'Cost' tab displaying monthly costs for each developer plus unassigned tasks. Shows past, current, and future months with filtering options. Includes grand total, average monthly cost, and peak monthly cost. CSV export functionality included. Stories are costed using hourly rates x story points x hours per point from forecast config. Uses completed story actual end dates or estimated dates for incomplete stories.
Architecture: New files: costTabTemplate.js, costAnalysisFunctions.js. Updated userStoriesDevCommands.ts (added tab, scripts, CSS), userStoryDevView.js (added renderCostTab).

2025-10-11 - Add click-to-edit functionality to Sprint Tab stories
Command: Enable clicking on backlog stories and sprint table rows to open edit modal
Status: Completed
Notes: Added onclick handlers to both backlog story cards and sprint stories table rows to call openStoryDetailModal(storyId). Updated CSS to show pointer cursor on backlog stories instead of move cursor, and added border highlight on hover. Sprint table rows also show pointer cursor.
Architecture: Modified sprintTabTemplate.js (added onclick to backlog-story div and sprint table rows). Modified userStoriesDevCommands.ts CSS (changed cursor from 'move' to 'pointer', added border-color on hover).

2025-10-11 - Add click-to-edit functionality to Sprint Card stories
Command: Enable clicking on stories assigned to sprints to open edit modal
Status: Completed
Notes: Added onclick handler to sprint-story-item divs in sprint cards. Handler checks if close button was clicked (event.stopPropagation on button), otherwise opens edit modal. Updated CSS to show pointer cursor and hover effects on sprint story items.
Architecture: Modified sprintTabTemplate.js (added onclick with event propagation check to sprint-story-item). Modified userStoriesDevCommands.ts CSS (added cursor: pointer, transition, and hover state to .sprint-story-item).

3. Drag item to new position
4. System auto-resequences all affected items
5. Changes save immediately to app-dna-user-story-dev.json
6. Board tab reflects new ordering
7. Optional: Use Auto-Sequence or Reset buttons

INTEGRATION:
- Reuses existing sortByQueuePosition() function
- Reuses existing showStoryDetailModal() for click
- Coordinates with Board tab via refreshBoard()
- Sends batch updates via batchUpdateQueuePositions command
- Extension handles file I/O and persistence

TESTING CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Tab appears between Details and Analysis

Command: Add 'Calculate Queue Position' button to Dev Queue tab based on data object hierarchy rank
Date: October 12, 2025
Status:  COMPLETED

Details:
- Added 'Calculate Queue Position' button to dev queue tab
- Created new dataObjectRankCalculator.js script with ranking logic
- Implemented data object extraction from user story text (same logic as data object usage analysis)
- Implemented hierarchy rank calculation (rank 1 = root objects, rank 2 = children, etc.)
- Added message handlers in userStoriesDevCommands.ts:
  - getDataObjectsForRanking: loads all data objects from model
  - bulkUpdateQueuePositions: updates multiple queue positions at once
- Updated userStoryDevView.js to handle ranking responses
- Integrated with existing queue position system
- Stories are sorted by data object rank, then by story number as tiebreaker
- New positions assigned as 10, 20, 30, etc. for easy reordering

Architecture Notes:
- Data object rank calculated recursively through parent relationships
- Root objects (no parent) = rank 1 (highest priority)
- Each child level increases rank by 1
- Stories referencing multiple objects use the lowest rank (highest priority object)
- Follows same data object extraction patterns as userStoryUtils.ts
- Integrates with existing dev queue tab and queue position management

Files Modified:
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/devQueueTabTemplate.js (added button)
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/dataObjectRankCalculator.js (NEW)
- src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts (added message handlers and script URI)
- src/webviews/userStoryDev/userStoryDevView.js (added message handlers)
