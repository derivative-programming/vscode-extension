2025-10-13: Successfully removed VS Code dependencies from MCP server components
- Modified UserStoryTools to use in-memory storage only (removed ModelService dependency)
- Removed role validation methods that required model access
- Simplified create_user_story and list_user_stories methods for standalone operation
- TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
- Compiled JavaScript verified to have no 'vscode' imports
- MCP server architecture: stdio-based server using @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- Status: Ready for testing with GitHub Copilot integration

2025-10-13: Added 'secret_word_of_the_day' tool to MCP server
- Created secret_word_of_the_day method in UserStoryTools class
- Generates unique word daily based on date + project identifier hash
- Uses curated list of interesting words (quantum, nebula, cipher, etc.)
- Registered tool in MCP server with proper error handling
- Added to package.json languageModelTools for Copilot discovery
- Tool is unique to this MCP server and project files
- TypeScript compilation successful

2025-10-13: Identified MCP server discovery issue
- GitHub Copilot not recognizing extension's languageModelTools during development
- Copilot found different MCP server in 'test-vscode-extension' directory
- Created MCP_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md with user settings configuration
- Fixed mcp.json launch configuration to use Node.js instead of VS Code executable
- Issue: Extension languageModelTools may only work when extension is installed, not in development
- Solution: Configure MCP server in user settings under 'github.copilot.chat.mcp'

2025-10-13: Fixed working directory issue in MCP configuration
- VS Code auto-creates MCP config with wrong cwd: "c:\\Users\\vince\\Documents\\test-vscode-extension"
- Updated MCP_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md with fix for auto-generated config
- User needs to update VS Code settings to use correct cwd: "c:\\VR\\Source\\DP\\vscode-extension"
- Alternative: Use github.copilot.chat.mcp configuration format
- After fixing cwd, Copilot should be able to access secret_word_of_the_day tool

2025-10-13: Implemented automatic MCP configuration
- Modified extension activation to automatically configure MCP settings
- Extension now creates .vscode/settings.json with correct MCP server config on activation
- Exported configureMcpSettings function for use by extension.ts
- Fixed workspace folder handling in extension.ts
- MCP server configuration now uses extension path resolution for portability
- Users no longer need manual configuration - extension handles it automatically
- TypeScript compilation successful

2025-10-13: Fixed TypeScript compilation error in mcpCommands.ts
- Resolved "import/export may only appear at the top level" error
- Fixed duplicate configureMcpSettings function declarations
- Removed orphaned function body that was causing parsing errors
- TypeScript compilation now succeeds without errors
- Extension should now activate properly

2025-10-13: Fixed module import path error preventing extension activation
- Corrected import path in generalFlowCommands.ts from '../webviews/generalFlowDetailsView' to '../webviews/generalFlow/generalFlowDetailsView'
- File exists in src/webviews/generalFlow/ directory, not directly in webviews/
- TypeScript compilation successful with webpack bundling
- Extension activation should now work without "Cannot find module" errors
- MCP server with secret word tool ready for GitHub Copilot integration

2025-10-15: Comprehensive MCP view command descriptions for AI consumption
- CRITICAL INSIGHT: MCP tool descriptions ARE exposed to consumers - they're part of the tool definition
- Created ViewTools class (src/mcp/tools/viewTools.ts) with methods for all view opening operations
- Updated MCP server (src/mcp/server.ts) to register 30+ view tools with detailed descriptions
- Each description explains: what the view shows, available tabs (with values), parameters, and use cases
- Description format makes tools discoverable and understandable by AI assistants (Claude, etc.)
- Updated server name from 'appdna-user-stories' to 'appdna-extension' to reflect broader scope
- Architecture: MCP Server ‚Üí ViewTools ‚Üí VS Code Commands (mcpViewCommands.ts)
- Tools organized by category: User Stories, Data Objects, Forms/Pages, Workflows, Reports/APIs, Analysis, Diagrams, Settings
- Views with initialTab support: User Stories (3 tabs), User Stories Dev (8 tabs), User Stories QA (5 tabs), Object Details (3 tabs)
- Created comprehensive documentation: docs/MCP-VIEW-COMMANDS-REFERENCE.md
- Benefits: Self-documenting, discovery-friendly, maintainable, consistent
- TypeScript compilation successful - all tools ready for MCP consumption
- Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - MCP consumers can now understand and use all 30+ view opening tools

2025-10-15: Added MCP commands for detail views (forms, pages, reports, workflows, APIs)
- Extended MCP coverage from 30 to 39 views (95% of all views)
