# MCP HTTP Server Implementation for GitHub Copilot Integration

## Issue Description

The MCP HTTP Server was experiencing 404 errors when GitHub Copilot attempted to connect to it. The logs showed:

```
2025-05-10 16:04:02.290 [info] Starting server AppDNAUserStoryMCPHttp
2025-05-10 16:04:02.290 [info] Connection state: Starting
2025-05-10 16:04:02.298 [info] Starting server from LocalProcess extension host
2025-05-10 16:04:02.298 [info] Connection state: Running
2025-05-10 16:04:02.307 [info] 404 status sending message to http://localhost:3000/, will attempt to fall back to legacy SSE
2025-05-10 16:04:02.316 [info] Connection state: Error 404 status connecting to http://localhost:3000/ as SSE: Not Found
2025-05-10 16:04:02.317 [error] Server exited before responding to `initialize` request.
```

This was occurring because the HTTP server was missing several endpoints required by GitHub Copilot's MCP client and needed to be updated according to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification.

## Solution Implemented

We updated the HTTP server to fully comply with the MCP specification for GitHub Copilot:

1. **Root path (`/`) for SSE connections**:
   - Added support for Server-Sent Events at the root endpoint
   - Implemented support for sessionId parameter
   - Added JSON-RPC compliant connected message
   - Implemented keep-alive ping messages
   - Handled connection lifecycle events

2. **Initialize endpoint (`/initialize`)**:
   - Added a JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant handler for the initialize request
   - Returns detailed capabilities and available tools
   - Handles both `/initialize` path and root path POST requests with 'initialize' method

3. **Standard discovery endpoint (`/.well-known/mcp`)**:
   - Implemented the standard MCP discovery endpoint
   - Returns server capabilities, available tools and transport methods

4. **Improved MCP base endpoint (`/mcp`)**:
   - Enhanced to return full URLs for all endpoints
   - Added transport capabilities and endpoint listing
   - Better compliance with Copilot Studio requirements

5. **Updated VS Code integration**:
   - Added proper transport type in settings.json
   - Enhanced mcp-http.json configuration with complete endpoints
   - Added autoStart flag for better user experience

6. **Improved error handling and logging**:
   - Enhanced debugging for unknown requests
   - Added header logging to troubleshoot connection issues
   - Provides helpful endpoint information for mistyped URLs

## Testing the Connection

To test if the HTTP server is correctly handling GitHub Copilot connections:

1. Start the MCP HTTP Server from the VS Code extension
2. Check the logs to ensure there are no 404 errors
3. Verify that GitHub Copilot can successfully connect to the server
4. Test interactions with the MCP tools via GitHub Copilot

## Next Steps

If connection issues persist, consider:

1. Adding more diagnostic logging to track the complete request/response cycle
2. Implementing WebSocket support as an alternative to SSE
3. Adding more detailed error handling for edge cases
