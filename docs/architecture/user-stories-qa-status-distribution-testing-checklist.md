## Known Limitations

### Expected Behavior
- SVG tooltip positioning may vary slightly based on screen resolution
- PNG export quality depends on display scaling
- D3.js library loads from CDN (requires internet connection on first load)
- Semantic colors are hardcoded (not theme-adaptive by design)

### Not Implemented (Out of Scope)
- Historical trend analysis
- Click-to-filter functionality
- Custom color configuration
- CSV export of distribution data
- Animated transitions

## Success Criteria

### Must Have ✅
- [ ] Histogram displays all five QA statuses
- [ ] Bars use correct semantic colors
- [ ] Fixed status order (workflow-based)
- [ ] Summary statistics calculate correctly
- [ ] Tooltips show on hover
- [ ] Refresh button works
- [ ] PNG export works and saves correctly

### Nice to Have ✅
- [ ] Smooth animations (bar rendering)
- [ ] Loading state displays during render
- [ ] Console logging for debugging
- [ ] Theme compatibility (all themes)
- [ ] Responsive width adaptation
