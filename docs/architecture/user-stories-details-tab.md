# User Stories Details### Enhanced Functionality

#### Role Extraction
- Uses existing `extractRoleFromUserStory()` function
- Supports both user story formats:
  - "A [Role] wants to..."
  - "As a [Role], I want to..."
- Returns "Unknown" if no role can be extracted

#### Action Extraction (Enhanced September 28, 2025)
- **Sophisticated Pattern Matching**: Uses context-aware regex patterns from proven page mapping logic
- **Dual Format Support**: Handles both "wants to" and "I want to" sentence structures
- **Prioritized "View All"**: Uses `/wants to\s+(view all|view|add|create|update|edit|delete|remove)(?:\s+(?:a|an|all))?\s+/i` pattern
- **Optional Articles**: Properly handles optional articles (a, an, all) in user story text
- **Action Normalization**: Consistently normalizes variants:
  - "create" → "add"
  - "edit" → "update" 
  - "remove" → "delete"
- **Fallback Strategy**: Maintains simple word matching for edge cases
- **Improved Accuracy**: More reliable extraction from well-formed user stories
- Returns "unknown" if no action can be identifiedn

**Created:** September 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview

Added a new "Details" tab to the User Stories view that provides a detailed breakdown of user stories with extracted role and action information. This tab sits between the existing "Stories" and "Analytics" tabs and shows a 4-column table with enhanced analysis of each user story.

## Features Implemented

### Tab Structure
- **Position**: Between "Stories" and "Analytics" tabs in the tabbed interface
- **Activation**: Click-based tab switching using existing tab functionality
- **Consistency**: Follows the same UI patterns and styling as other tabs

### Table Columns
1. **Story Number**: Same as main Stories tab
2. **Story Text**: Complete user story text
3. **Role**: Extracted role from the user story (e.g., "Manager", "User", "Admin")
4. **Action**: Extracted action type (e.g., "view", "view all", "add", "update", "delete")

### Functionality

#### Role Extraction
- Uses existing `extractRoleFromUserStory()` function
- Supports both user story formats:
  - "A [Role] wants to..."
  - "As a [Role], I want to..."
- Returns "Unknown" if no role can be extracted

#### Action Extraction
- New `extractActionFromUserStory()` function created
- Recognizes primary actions: view, view all, add, update, delete
- Normalizes action variants:
  - "create" → "add"
  - "edit" → "update" 
  - "remove" → "delete"
- Prioritizes "view all" over individual "view" actions
- Returns "unknown" if no action can be identified

#### Table Operations
- **Sorting**: Click column headers to sort by Story Number (numeric), Story Text, Role, or Action (all alphabetic except Story Number)
- **Search**: Real-time filtering across all 4 columns simultaneously
- **Synchronization**: Automatically updates when stories are added via:
  - Modal dialog (single or multiple stories)
  - CSV upload
  - Bulk operations

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `src/webviews/userStoriesView.js`: Complete implementation including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Functions Added
```javascript
function extractActionFromUserStory(text) {
    // Extracts action from user story text
    // Returns: "view", "view all", "add", "update", "delete", or "unknown"
}
```

### DOM Elements Added
- `#details-tab`: Tab content container
- `#userStoriesDetailsTable`: Main details table
- `#detailsSearchInput`: Search input for filtering details

### Event Handlers Added
- Details table column header click handlers for sorting
- Details search input event handler for real-time filtering
- Synchronization handlers for story addition events

### CSS Classes
- Reuses existing table styling and VS Code theming variables
- Maintains consistent visual appearance with other tabs
- Proper hover states and interactive elements

## Data Flow

### Initial Load
1. User stories loaded from model via ModelService
2. Role and action extracted for each story using parsing functions
3. Details table populated with extracted data

### Story Addition
1. New story added via Stories tab (modal or CSV)
2. Extension sends `userStoryAdded` or `userStoriesAdded` message
3. Webview receives message and updates both main table and details table
4. Role and action extracted for new stories in real-time

### Synchronization Points
- Single story addition (`userStoryAdded` case)
- Bulk story addition (`userStoriesAdded` case) 
- CSV upload completion (`csvUploadResults` case)

## User Experience

### Benefits
- **Enhanced Analysis**: See role and action breakdown at a glance
- **Better Organization**: Sort by role or action type to group related stories
- **Comprehensive Search**: Find stories by any attribute including extracted metadata
- **Consistency**: Familiar interface following established patterns

### Workflow Integration
- Seamless integration with existing user story management workflow
- No impact on existing Stories tab functionality
- Provides additional analytical view without cluttering main interface
- Real-time updates ensure details always match current story data

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Potential Improvements
1. **Data Object Extraction**: Add column showing extracted data objects
2. **Story Validation**: Visual indicators for incomplete or malformed stories
3. **Export Functionality**: CSV export of the detailed view
4. **Filtering Controls**: Dropdown filters for specific roles or actions
5. **Analytics Integration**: Use extracted data for future analytics features

### Performance Considerations
- Role/action extraction is performed on-demand during table building
- No significant performance impact for typical story counts
- Could be optimized with caching for very large datasets

## Architecture Notes

### Design Patterns
- Follows established webview communication pattern
- Maintains separation of concerns between UI and data extraction
- Uses existing utility functions where possible
- Consistent error handling and fallback values

### Code Organization
- Action extraction function added near existing extraction functions
- Table functionality grouped with other table operations
- Event handlers follow existing patterns and naming conventions
- Synchronization code added to existing message handlers

### Integration Points
- ModelService: Data source for user stories
- Existing extraction functions: Role parsing
- Tab system: UI navigation and state management
- Message passing: Extension-webview communication
