# Form Details View Issues and Fixes

## Issues Found (2025-07-13):
1. **Empty Implementation Functions**: The `updateModelDirectly` and `updateSettingsDirectly` functions in `formDetailsView.js` were placeholder functions that only logged messages, not actually updating the model.

2. **Command Name Mismatch**: The form UI event handlers were sending an `updateForm` command, but the message handler was only expecting `updateSettings` and `updateModel` commands.

3. **Missing Settings Handlers**: The form control utilities lacked proper event handlers to send `updateSettings` commands for individual property changes.

## Fixes Applied:
1. **Implemented Model Update Functions**: Added proper implementations for `updateModelDirectly` and `updateSettingsDirectly` in `formDetailsView.js`, following the same pattern as the working report details view.

2. **Added updateForm Command Handler**: Added a new case for handling `updateForm` commands for backward compatibility.

3. **Enhanced Form Control Utilities**: Added `setupSettingsInputHandlers()` function to properly handle checkbox and input changes for settings, sending `updateSettings` commands with proper property/exists/value structure.

4. **Fixed UI Event Handlers**: Removed conflicting updateForm logic from `uiEventHandlers.js` and integrated the proper settings handlers through the DOM initialization.

5. **Connected DOM Initialization**: Ensured `setupSettingsInputHandlers()` is called during DOM initialization to properly wire up the event handlers.

## Key Pattern for Model Updates:
- Settings changes send: `{ command: 'updateSettings', data: { property, exists, value } }`
- The backend handles individual property updates and calls `modelService.markUnsavedChanges()`
- Tree view is refreshed with `vscode.commands.executeCommand("appdna.refresh")`
