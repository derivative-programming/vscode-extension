# Mermaid Diagram Tab Enhancement (July 18, 2025)

Enhanced the Mermaid diagram tab in the Page Flow view to provide the same level of zoom/pan interaction as the D3.js graph view:

## Key Improvements:
- **Enhanced Zoom Functionality**: 
  - Mouse wheel zoom centered on mouse position
  - Variable zoom factors based on zoom level (1.15, 1.1, 1.05)
  - Zoom range from 0.05 to 20 (matching D3 graph)
  - Smooth zoom transitions

- **Advanced Pan Support**:
  - Drag-to-pan using mouse button
  - Proper cursor feedback (grab/grabbing)
  - Mobile device touch support

- **Improved Touch Support**:
  - Pinch to zoom gesture with proper centering
  - Single finger pan gesture
  - Prevents default scroll behavior for better experience

## Implementation Details:
- Uses CSS transforms for both translation (pan) and scaling (zoom)
- State variables track zoom level (mermaidZoom) and pan position (mermaidPanX, mermaidPanY)
- Dynamically adjusts container dimensions based on content and zoom level
- Maintains proper transform origin for intuitive zoom behavior
- Initializes automatically after Mermaid diagram rendering

The result is a consistent interaction model across both visualization tabs, with the Mermaid diagram now offering the same level of intuitive navigation as the D3.js graph view.
- Improved maintainability and readability
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing and debugging
- Follows established patterns in the codebase
