# Calculate Queue Position Feature - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Feature**: Calculate Queue Position based on Data Object Hierarchy Rank  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Overview

Added a "Calculate Queue Position" button to the Dev Queue tab that automatically calculates and assigns queue positions based on the hierarchy rank of data objects referenced in user stories. This allows developers to prioritize stories by building foundational data objects (parent objects) before their dependent children objects.

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Data Object Hierarchy Ranking**

The system calculates a "rank" for each data object based on its position in the hierarchy:

- **Rank 1**: Root objects (no parent) - Highest priority
- **Rank 2**: Direct children of rank 1 objects
- **Rank 3**: Children of rank 2 objects
- And so on...

Example hierarchy:
```
Customer (Rank 1 - no parent)
├── Order (Rank 2 - child of Customer)
│   ├── OrderItem (Rank 3 - child of Order)
│   └── OrderPayment (Rank 3 - child of Order)
└── CustomerAddress (Rank 2 - child of Customer)
```

### 2. **User Story Analysis**

For each incomplete user story:
1. Extract data object names from the story text using the same pattern matching logic as the Data Object Usage Analysis view
2. Calculate the rank for each referenced data object
3. Select the data object with the **lowest rank** (highest priority) as the "primary" object

### 3. **Queue Position Calculation**

- Sort incomplete stories by:
  1. Primary data object rank (ascending - lower rank = higher priority)
  2. Story number (ascending - as tiebreaker)
- Assign new queue positions: 10, 20, 30, 40, etc.
- Save to `app-dna-user-story-dev.json`

## User Interface

### Button Location
Dev Queue tab → Top action bar → "Calculate Queue Position" button

### Button Details
- **Icon**: `codicon-symbol-class` (data object icon)
- **Label**: "Calculate Queue Position"
- **Tooltip**: "Calculate queue positions based on data object hierarchy rank"
- **Position**: Left of "Auto-Sequence" button

### User Experience
1. User clicks "Calculate Queue Position" button
2. Spinner overlay appears
3. System:
   - Loads all data objects from model
   - Analyzes each user story's text
   - Calculates hierarchy ranks
   - Sorts and assigns new positions
4. Success message displays: "Queue positions calculated successfully!\n\nX stories reordered by data object hierarchy rank."
5. Dev Queue tab automatically refreshes to show new order

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
User clicks button
    ↓
calculateQueueByDataObjectRank() [JavaScript]
    ↓
Message: 'getDataObjectsForRanking' → Extension
    ↓
Extension loads data objects from model.namespace[0].obj
    ↓
Message: 'setDataObjectsForRanking' → Webview
    ↓
handleDataObjectRankingResponse() [JavaScript]
    ↓
For each incomplete story:
  - extractDataObjectsFromStory()
  - calculateDataObjectRank() (recursive)
  - getPrimaryDataObjectForStory()
    ↓
Sort by rank, then story number
    ↓
Message: 'bulkUpdateQueuePositions' → Extension
    ↓
Extension saves to app-dna-user-story-dev.json
    ↓
Extension reloads data
    ↓
Message: 'queuePositionsUpdated' → Webview
    ↓
Webview refreshes Dev Queue tab
```

## Data Object Extraction Logic

The feature uses the same extraction logic as the Data Object Usage Analysis view:

### Pattern 1: "View all [objects] in a/the [container]"
```
"View all orders in a customer"
→ Extracts: "order", "orders", "customer", "customers"
→ Target for "view all": "order" (the first object - the one being viewed)
```

### Pattern 2: Action verb patterns
```
"Add a customer"
"Edit an order" 
"Delete a product"
→ Extracts: singular and plural variants
```

### Special Handling
- Removes articles: "a", "an", "the", "all"
- Stops at boundaries: "in", "for", "to", "when", "where", "with", "by", "from"
- Excludes "application" from extraction
- Generates both singular and plural variants

### Name Resolution Process
1. **Extract**: Extract object names from story text (e.g., "customers", "customer email request")
2. **Resolve**: Use `resolveDataObjectName()` to find actual model object (e.g., "Customer", "CustomerEmailRequest")
3. **Validate**: Only use objects that successfully resolve to model objects
4. **Calculate**: Calculate rank using the resolved model object name

This ensures:
- "customers" → "Customer" (plural to singular)
- "customer email request" → "CustomerEmailRequest" (space-separated to PascalCase)
- Invalid/unknown objects are filtered out

### Target Object Selection Logic
- **For "view all" actions**: Uses the FIRST extracted object (the object being viewed)
  - Example: "view all Organizations in a Customer" → Target is Organization
- **For other actions**: Uses the LOWEST RANK object (highest priority in hierarchy)
  - Example: "update an Order in a Customer" → Target is Customer (rank 1)

---

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Hierarchy
**Data Objects:**
- Customer (rank 1)
- Order (rank 2, parent: Customer)

**User Stories:**
1. "Add a customer" → References Customer (rank 1)
2. "View all orders in a customer" → References Order & Customer, uses Order for "view all" → rank 2
3. "Delete an order" → References Order (rank 2)

**Result:**
- Story 1: Position 10 (rank 1) - Customer first (parent object)
- Story 2: Position 20 (rank 2) - Order (child object, but view all uses the object being viewed)
- Story 3: Position 30 (rank 2) - Order

### Scenario 2: Multi-Level Hierarchy
**Data Objects:**
- Customer (rank 1)
- Order (rank 2, parent: Customer)
- OrderItem (rank 3, parent: Order)

**User Stories:**
1. "Add an order item" → rank 3
2. "Create a customer" → rank 1
3. "View all orders" → rank 2

**Result:**
- Story 2: Position 10 (rank 1)
- Story 3: Position 20 (rank 2)
- Story 1: Position 30 (rank 3)

## Sorting Algorithm

The feature uses a **three-level sort** to determine queue positions:

### Level 1: Data Object Rank (Primary)
- Rank 1 = Root objects (no parent)
- Rank 2 = Children of root objects
- Rank 3+ = Deeper hierarchy levels
- Lower rank = higher priority (developed first)

### Level 2: Data Object Name (Secondary)
- If stories have the same rank, sort alphabetically by data object name
- Example: "Customer" comes before "EmailRequest" at rank 2

### Level 3: Action Order (Tertiary)
- If stories have the same rank and same data object, sort by action type
- Action order:
  - **Add** = 0 (highest priority - create the object first)
  - **View All** = 1 (list view after creation)
  - **View** = 2 (detail view)
  - **Update** = 3 (modify after viewing)
  - **Delete** = 4 (delete after all other operations)
  - **Other** = 5 (unknown actions last)

### Action Extraction
Uses the same pattern as User Stories List View:
- Detects "wants to [action]" and "I want to [action]" patterns
- Normalizes variants: create→add, edit→update, remove→delete
- Returns standardized action strings

### Example Sort Order
Given these stories:
- Story 1: User wants to **update** a **Customer** (rank 2)
- Story 2: User wants to **add** a **Customer** (rank 2)
- Story 3: User wants to **view** an **EmailRequest** (rank 2)
- Story 4: User wants to **add** a **Department** (rank 1)

Final order:
1. Story 4: Department (rank 1, add)
2. Story 2: Customer (rank 2, add) - Customer before EmailRequest alphabetically
3. Story 1: Customer (rank 2, update) - Update after Add for same object
4. Story 3: EmailRequest (rank 2, view) - EmailRequest after Customer

## Benefits

1. **Logical Development Order**: Build parent objects before child objects
2. **Reduces Dependencies**: Foundational objects are developed first
3. **Action-Based Workflow**: Add → View → Update → Delete sequence
4. **Automatic Prioritization**: No manual sorting required
5. **Consistent with Data Model**: Follows actual data object hierarchy
6. **Easy to Adjust**: Positions are 10, 20, 30, etc., allowing easy manual reordering

---

## Integration Points

### With Existing Features

1. **Dev Queue Tab**
   - Works alongside existing drag-and-drop reordering
   - Compatible with "Auto-Sequence" and "Reset to Story Numbers" buttons
   - Positions saved to same `developmentQueuePosition` field

2. **Board Tab**
   - Calculated positions control display order in Kanban columns
   - Stories appear in priority order within each status column

3. **Data Object Usage Analysis**
   - Uses same extraction logic for consistency
   - Both features identify referenced data objects the same way

4. **Data Object Hierarchy View**
   - Rank calculation based on same parent-child relationships
   - Visual hierarchy diagram shows the ranks being used

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for future versions:

1. **Show Rank in UI**: Display calculated rank next to each story in the queue
2. **Filter by Rank**: Add filter to show only stories of specific ranks
3. **Rank Badges**: Visual indicators for rank levels (color-coded)
4. **Manual Rank Override**: Allow users to manually set object ranks
5. **Conflict Resolution**: UI to handle stories with no detected data objects
6. **Analytics**: Chart showing distribution of stories across ranks
