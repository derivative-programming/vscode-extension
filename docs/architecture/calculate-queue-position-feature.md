# Calculate Queue Position Feature - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Feature**: Calculate Queue Position based on Data Object Hierarchy Rank  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Overview

Added a "Calculate Queue Position" button to the Dev Queue tab that automatically calculates and assigns queue positions based on the hierarchy rank of data objects referenced in user stories. This allows developers to prioritize stories by building foundational data objects (parent objects) before their dependent children objects.

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Data Object Hierarchy Ranking**

The system calculates a "rank" for each data object based on its position in the hierarchy:

- **Rank 1**: Root objects (no parent) - Highest priority
- **Rank 2**: Direct children of rank 1 objects
- **Rank 3**: Children of rank 2 objects
- And so on...

Example hierarchy:
```
Customer (Rank 1 - no parent)
├── Order (Rank 2 - child of Customer)
│   ├── OrderItem (Rank 3 - child of Order)
│   └── OrderPayment (Rank 3 - child of Order)
└── CustomerAddress (Rank 2 - child of Customer)
```

### 2. **User Story Analysis**

For each incomplete user story:
1. Extract data object names from the story text using the same pattern matching logic as the Data Object Usage Analysis view
2. Calculate the rank for each referenced data object
3. Select the data object with the **lowest rank** (highest priority) as the "primary" object

### 3. **Queue Position Calculation**

- Sort incomplete stories by:
  1. Primary data object rank (ascending - lower rank = higher priority)
  2. Story number (ascending - as tiebreaker)
- Assign new queue positions: 10, 20, 30, 40, etc.
- Save to `app-dna-user-story-dev.json`

## User Interface

### Button Location
Dev Queue tab → Top action bar → "Calculate Queue Position" button

### Button Details
- **Icon**: `codicon-symbol-class` (data object icon)
- **Label**: "Calculate Queue Position"
- **Tooltip**: "Calculate queue positions based on data object hierarchy rank"
- **Position**: Left of "Auto-Sequence" button

### User Experience
1. User clicks "Calculate Queue Position" button
2. Spinner overlay appears
3. System:
   - Loads all data objects from model
   - Analyzes each user story's text
   - Calculates hierarchy ranks
   - Sorts and assigns new positions
4. Success message displays: "Queue positions calculated successfully!\n\nX stories reordered by data object hierarchy rank."
5. Dev Queue tab automatically refreshes to show new order

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
User clicks button
    ↓
calculateQueueByDataObjectRank() [JavaScript]
    ↓
Message: 'getDataObjectsForRanking' → Extension
    ↓
Extension loads data objects from model.namespace[0].obj
    ↓
Message: 'setDataObjectsForRanking' → Webview
    ↓
handleDataObjectRankingResponse() [JavaScript]
    ↓
For each incomplete story:
  - extractDataObjectsFromStory()
  - calculateDataObjectRank() (recursive)
  - getPrimaryDataObjectForStory()
    ↓
Sort by rank, then story number
    ↓
Message: 'bulkUpdateQueuePositions' → Extension
    ↓
Extension saves to app-dna-user-story-dev.json
    ↓
Extension reloads data
    ↓
Message: 'queuePositionsUpdated' → Webview
    ↓
Webview refreshes Dev Queue tab
```

### Files Created

**1. `src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/dataObjectRankCalculator.js`**
   - 370 lines
   - Main calculation logic
   - Functions:
     - `extractDataObjectsFromStory()` - Extract data object names from story text
     - `addSingularPluralVariants()` - Handle plural/singular matching
     - `isDataObjectMatch()` - Compare data object names
     - `calculateDataObjectRank()` - Recursive rank calculation
     - `getPrimaryDataObjectForStory()` - Find lowest rank object in story
     - `calculateQueueByDataObjectRank()` - Main entry point (called by button)
     - `handleDataObjectRankingResponse()` - Process response from extension

### Files Modified

**1. `src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/templates/devQueueTabTemplate.js`**
   - Added "Calculate Queue Position" button to action bar
   - Button calls `calculateQueueByDataObjectRank()`

**2. `src/commands/userStoriesDevCommands.ts`**
   - Added `dataObjectRankCalculator` to scriptUris
   - Added script tag in HTML generation
   - Added two message handlers:
     - `case 'getDataObjectsForRanking'`: Loads data objects from model
     - `case 'bulkUpdateQueuePositions'`: Updates queue positions and reloads data

**3. `src/webviews/userStoryDev/userStoryDevView.js`**
   - Added two message handlers:
     - `case 'setDataObjectsForRanking'`: Calls ranking calculation
     - `case 'queuePositionsUpdated'`: Refreshes dev queue tab

## Data Object Extraction Logic

The feature uses the same extraction logic as the Data Object Usage Analysis view:

### Pattern 1: "View all [objects] in a/the [container]"
```
"View all orders in a customer"
→ Extracts: "order", "orders", "customer", "customers"
```

### Pattern 2: Action verb patterns
```
"Add a customer"
"Edit an order" 
"Delete a product"
→ Extracts: singular and plural variants
```

### Special Handling
- Removes articles: "a", "an", "the", "all"
- Stops at boundaries: "in", "for", "to", "when", "where", "with", "by", "from"
- Excludes "application" from extraction
- Generates both singular and plural variants

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Hierarchy
**Data Objects:**
- Customer (rank 1)
- Order (rank 2, parent: Customer)

**User Stories:**
1. "Add a customer" → References Customer (rank 1)
2. "View orders in a customer" → References Order (rank 2), Customer (rank 1) → Uses rank 1
3. "Delete an order" → References Order (rank 2)

**Result:**
- Story 1: Position 10 (rank 1)
- Story 2: Position 20 (rank 1)
- Story 3: Position 30 (rank 2)

### Scenario 2: Multi-Level Hierarchy
**Data Objects:**
- Customer (rank 1)
- Order (rank 2, parent: Customer)
- OrderItem (rank 3, parent: Order)

**User Stories:**
1. "Add an order item" → rank 3
2. "Create a customer" → rank 1
3. "View all orders" → rank 2

**Result:**
- Story 2: Position 10 (rank 1)
- Story 3: Position 20 (rank 2)
- Story 1: Position 30 (rank 3)

## Benefits

1. **Logical Development Order**: Build parent objects before child objects
2. **Reduces Dependencies**: Foundational objects are developed first
3. **Automatic Prioritization**: No manual sorting required
4. **Consistent with Data Model**: Follows actual data object hierarchy
5. **Easy to Adjust**: Positions are 10, 20, 30, etc., allowing easy manual reordering

---

## Integration Points

### With Existing Features

1. **Dev Queue Tab**
   - Works alongside existing drag-and-drop reordering
   - Compatible with "Auto-Sequence" and "Reset to Story Numbers" buttons
   - Positions saved to same `developmentQueuePosition` field

2. **Board Tab**
   - Calculated positions control display order in Kanban columns
   - Stories appear in priority order within each status column

3. **Data Object Usage Analysis**
   - Uses same extraction logic for consistency
   - Both features identify referenced data objects the same way

4. **Data Object Hierarchy View**
   - Rank calculation based on same parent-child relationships
   - Visual hierarchy diagram shows the ranks being used

---

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for future versions:

1. **Show Rank in UI**: Display calculated rank next to each story in the queue
2. **Filter by Rank**: Add filter to show only stories of specific ranks
3. **Rank Badges**: Visual indicators for rank levels (color-coded)
4. **Manual Rank Override**: Allow users to manually set object ranks
5. **Conflict Resolution**: UI to handle stories with no detected data objects
6. **Analytics**: Chart showing distribution of stories across ranks

## Console Logging

The feature includes comprehensive console logging for debugging:

```javascript
// In webview
console.log('Calculating queue positions based on data object hierarchy rank...');
console.log(`Received ${dataObjects.length} data objects for ranking`);
console.log(`Processing ${incompleteItems.length} incomplete stories`);
console.log(`Story references: ${objectRanks.map(...)}`);
console.log(`Story ${storyNumber}: "..." -> Data Object: ${primaryObject}, Rank: ${rank}, New Position: ${pos}`);

// In extension
console.log('[Extension] Getting data objects for ranking calculation');
console.log(`[Extension] Sending ${dataObjects.length} data objects for ranking`);
console.log(`[Extension] Updated queue positions for ${updates.length} stories based on data object rank`);
```

## Error Handling

The feature includes error handling at multiple levels:

1. **Missing Data Objects**: Returns rank 999 (lowest priority)
2. **Parent Not Found**: Treats as root object (rank 1)
3. **No Story Text**: Empty array of extracted objects
4. **Extension Errors**: Shows error message to user
5. **Try-Catch Blocks**: All async operations wrapped
