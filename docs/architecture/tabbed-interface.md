# Tabbed Interface Implementation
Added a clean tabbed interface to organize the page flow view:
- **Force-Directed Graph Tab**: Contains the interactive D3.js diagram with zoom controls
- **Stats Tab**: Contains statistics, legend, and connection information
- **Professional Design**: Uses VS Code's design language with proper hover states and active indicators
- **Smart Resizing**: Automatically handles SVG resizing when switching back to the graph tab
- **State Preservation**: Tab switching preserves diagram state and user interactions

The tabs improve organization by separating the interactive visualization from the informational content, reducing visual clutter while maintaining easy access to both views.

## Zoom Controls Repositioning
Moved zoom controls from the main header into the Force-Directed Graph tab:
- **Better Context**: Zoom controls are now only visible when viewing the graph
- **Floating Overlay**: Positioned as a floating overlay in the top-right corner of the graph
- **Space Efficiency**: Frees up header space for other global controls
- **Professional Appearance**: Styled with subtle shadow and proper VS Code theming
- **High Z-Index**: Ensures controls stay above the graph content

The zoom controls (zoom in, zoom out, reset, and level indicator) are now contextually relevant and don't clutter the interface when viewing statistics.
