# Bulk Add Multi-Pass Validation System

## Overview
The Bulk Add Data Objects feature now supports **multi-pass validation** to handle dependency relationships regardless of input order. This means parent objects can be defined after their child objects in the input, and the validation system will correctly resolve all dependencies.

## How It Works

### Two-Phase Validation Process

#### Phase 1: Basic Validation
- **Purpose**: Parse and validate individual object properties
- **Validates**:
  - Line format (regex parsing for "is a child of" and "is a lookup")
  - Object name rules (PascalCase, no spaces, alpha only, max 100 chars)
  - Duplicate detection within input batch
  - **Existing object handling**: Mark existing objects as valid but flag for skipping
  - Lookup-specific rules (no "Lookup" in name)

#### Phase 2: Multi-Pass Dependency Resolution
- **Purpose**: Resolve parent-child relationships across multiple iterations
- **Process**:
  1. Start with all objects from Phase 1
  2. **Pass N**: Check each remaining object for resolvable dependencies
     - Lookup objects: Always valid (no parent dependency)
     - Child objects: Valid if parent exists in model OR in previously validated objects
  3. Remove validated objects from remaining list
  4. Repeat until all objects validated OR no progress made
  5. Any remaining objects have unresolved dependencies

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Child Before Parent ✅
```
Order is a child of Customer      ← Initially unresolved
Customer is a child of Pac        ← Resolves in Pass 1 (Pac exists in model)
OrderStatus is a lookup           ← Resolves in Pass 1 (no dependency)
```
**Result**: All valid after 2 passes

#### Scenario 2: Complex Chain ✅
```
OrderItem is a child of Order     ← Resolves in Pass 3
Order is a child of Customer      ← Resolves in Pass 2  
Customer is a child of Pac        ← Resolves in Pass 1
ProductCategory is a lookup       ← Resolves in Pass 1
Product is a child of ProductCategory ← Resolves in Pass 2
```
**Result**: All valid after 3 passes

#### Scenario 3: Existing Objects ✅
```
Pac is a child of Root             ← Existing object (marked as valid, will be skipped)
Customer is a child of Pac         ← New object (will be created)
NewOrder is a child of Customer    ← New object (will be created)
```
**Result**: 2 objects created, 1 existing skipped

#### Scenario 4: Missing Parent ❌
```
Order is a child of Customer      ← Never resolves (Customer not defined)
OrderItem is a child of Order     ← Never resolves (Order never validates)
```
**Result**: Both fail with "Parent object does not exist and is not defined in this input"

## Creation Order Management

After validation, objects are created in **dependency order** using the same multi-pass logic:

1. **Sort objects** by dependencies (parents before children)
2. **Skip existing objects** that are already in the model
3. **Create in order** to ensure referential integrity
4. **Handle lookup objects** first (no dependencies)
5. **Process child objects** only after their parents exist

## Technical Implementation

### Key Algorithm Components

```javascript
// Multi-pass validation loop
while (remainingObjects.length > 0 && passCount < maxPasses) {
    // Check each object for resolvable dependencies
    // Remove validated objects from remaining list
    // Break if no progress made this pass
}

// Dependency-ordered creation
while (remainingToCreate.length > 0) {
    // Process objects whose parents exist
    // Remove processed objects
    // Repeat until all created or no progress
}
```

### Safety Features

- **Maximum pass limit**: Prevents infinite loops
- **Progress detection**: Breaks if no objects validated in a pass
- **Circular dependency detection**: Fails gracefully with clear error message
- **Order preservation**: Line numbers maintained for error reporting

## User Experience

### Before Enhancement
- Objects had to be entered in dependency order
- Parent objects must come before child objects
- Confusing errors for out-of-order dependencies

### After Enhancement
- **Any order supported**: Child can be listed before parent
- **Existing objects allowed**: Objects already in model are marked as valid but skipped during creation
- **Clear visual feedback**: 
  - Green checkmarks (✓) for new valid objects
  - Orange warnings (⚠) for existing objects that will be skipped
  - Red X (✗) for validation errors
- **Intelligent processing**: System figures out the correct order automatically
- **Comprehensive success reporting**: Shows both created count and skipped count
- **Same validation rules**: All existing validation still applies

## Testing

Use the test cases in `test-bulk-dependency-order.js` to verify:
1. Child before parent scenarios
2. Complex dependency chains
3. Circular dependency detection
4. Mixed valid/invalid cases
5. Missing parent error handling
6. **Existing object handling**
7. **Mixed existing and new objects**
