## Notebook Cell Output

This section describes how to get the output of a notebook cell.

### `read_notebook_cell_output`

This tool will retrieve the output for a notebook cell from its most recent execution or restored from disk. The cell may have output even when it has not been run in the current kernel session. This tool has a higher token limit for output length than the runNotebookCell tool.

### `run_notebook_cell`

This is a tool for running a code cell in a notebook file directly in the notebook editor. The output from the execution will be returned. Code cells should be run as they are added or edited when working through a problem to bring the kernel state up to date and ensure the code executes successfully. Code cells are ready to run and don't require any pre-processing. If asked to run the first cell in a notebook, you should run the first code cell since markdown cells cannot be executed. NOTE: Avoid executing Markdown cells or providing Markdown cell IDs, as Markdown cells cannot be  executed.
