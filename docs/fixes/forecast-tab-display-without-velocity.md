# Forecast Tab Display Fix - Show Gantt Without Velocity Data

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Issue**: Gantt chart not displaying when only on-hold stories exist  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Problem

User reported: "I have many stories in the details tab on hold, but nothing is displayed on the gantt chart tab"

The Forecast tab was showing "No Velocity Data Available" even though the user had multiple stories with `on-hold` status. This was caused by two bugs:

### Bug 1: Wrong Field Check in Template

In `forecastTabTemplate.js`, line 16:
```javascript
const hasCompletedStories = hasStories && items.some(item => item.status === "Done");
```

This was checking the old field name `status` with old value `"Done"` instead of:
- New field: `devStatus`
- New value: `"completed"`

Since we recently changed from 8 statuses to 5 statuses and updated field names, this check was never finding any completed stories.

### Bug 2: Strict Requirement for Velocity Data

In `forecastFunctions.js`, the calculation required completed stories to calculate velocity:

```javascript
if (completedStories.length === 0) {
    return null; // Need velocity data
}
```

This meant:
- No completed stories → No velocity → No forecast → Empty chart
- Even if user had 50 stories "on-hold", nothing would display

## Solution

### Part 1: Check for Forecastable Stories Instead

Updated `forecastTabTemplate.js` to check if there are stories with **forecastable statuses** rather than checking for completed stories:

```javascript
function generateForecastTab(items, config) {
    const forecastConfig = config.forecastConfig || getDefaultForecastConfig();
    const hasStories = items && items.length > 0;
    const forecastableStatuses = ['on-hold', 'ready-for-dev', 'in-progress', 'blocked'];
    const hasForecastableStories = hasStories && items.some(item => 
        forecastableStatuses.includes(item.devStatus)
    );
    
    return `
        <div class="forecast-tab-container">
            ${generateForecastHeader(forecastConfig)}
            
            ${!hasStories ? generateForecastEmptyState("no-stories") : 
              !hasForecastableStories ? generateForecastEmptyState("no-forecastable") :
              generateForecastContent(items, forecastConfig)}
        </div>
    `;
}
```

**Key Changes**:
- Check for forecastable statuses: `on-hold`, `ready-for-dev`, `in-progress`, `blocked`
- Use `item.devStatus` (correct field)
- Show chart if ANY forecastable stories exist

### Part 2: Use Default Velocity When None Available

Updated `forecastFunctions.js` to use a default velocity when no completed stories exist:

```javascript
// Get completed and incomplete stories (use devStatus field)
const completedStories = items.filter(item => item.devStatus === "completed");
const incompleteStories = items.filter(item => forecastableStatuses.includes(item.devStatus));

if (incompleteStories.length === 0) {
    return null; // No stories to forecast
}

// Calculate average velocity (pass the full config which contains sprints)
// If no completed stories, use a default velocity or velocity override
let averageVelocity = forecastConfig.velocityOverride;
if (!averageVelocity) {
    averageVelocity = calculateAverageVelocity(items, config);
    // If still no velocity (no completed stories), use default of 10 points per sprint
    if (averageVelocity === 0) {
        averageVelocity = 10;
    }
}
```

**Key Changes**:
- Check if incomplete stories exist (not completed stories)
- Use velocity override if configured
- Fall back to calculated velocity from completed stories
- Use default of **10 points per sprint** if no velocity data available

### Part 3: Update Empty State Message

Updated the empty state reason and message:

```javascript
} else if (reason === "no-forecastable") {
    return `
        <div class="forecast-empty-state">
            <span class="codicon codicon-graph"></span>
            <h3>No Stories to Forecast</h3>
            <p>No stories with forecastable dev statuses (on-hold, ready-for-dev, in-progress, blocked) found.</p>
            <p class="forecast-empty-hint">
                <span class="codicon codicon-lightbulb"></span>
                Add stories and set their dev status in the Details or Board tabs to see the forecast timeline.
            </p>
        </div>
    `;
}
```

**Key Changes**:
- Changed from "no-velocity" to "no-forecastable"
- Updated message to guide users correctly
- Removed confusing "Mark stories as Done" message

## Default Velocity Rationale

**Why 10 points per sprint?**

This is a reasonable default for teams without historical data:
- Typical team: 3-5 developers
- Typical sprint: 2 weeks
- Typical story: 1-3 points
- Typical velocity: 8-12 points per sprint

**10 points per sprint** is a conservative middle ground that:
- Won't create overly optimistic forecasts
- Gives teams a starting baseline
- Can be overridden in forecast configuration
- Will be replaced by actual velocity once stories are completed

## Files Modified

1. **forecastTabTemplate.js**
   - Line 16: Changed field check from `status === "Done"` to forecastable statuses check
   - Line 19-22: Updated condition logic
   - Line 387-394: Updated empty state message

2. **forecastFunctions.js**
   - Lines 24-37: Updated velocity calculation logic with default fallback

## User Impact

### Before Fix
- User has 50 stories with "on-hold" status
- Forecast tab shows: "No Velocity Data Available"
- Message says: "Mark stories as Done to generate velocity data"
- **Result**: Gantt chart is empty, no timeline visible

### After Fix
- User has 50 stories with "on-hold" status
- Forecast tab shows: Gantt chart with timeline
- Uses default velocity of 10 points/sprint
- Stories are scheduled sequentially on timeline
- **Result**: User can see projected completion dates immediately

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Stories with on-hold status only
- **Setup**: 10 stories, all with `devStatus = "on-hold"`
- **Expected**: Gantt chart displays with default velocity
- **Result**: ✅ Chart shows timeline

### Test Case 2: Mix of forecastable statuses
- **Setup**: 5 on-hold, 3 ready-for-dev, 2 in-progress
- **Expected**: Gantt chart displays all 10 stories
- **Result**: ✅ Chart shows all stories

### Test Case 3: No forecastable stories
- **Setup**: All stories have `devStatus = "completed"`
- **Expected**: Shows "No Stories to Forecast" message
- **Result**: ✅ Correct empty state

### Test Case 4: With completed stories
- **Setup**: 5 completed, 10 on-hold
- **Expected**: Uses calculated velocity from completed stories
- **Result**: ✅ Uses actual velocity, not default

### Test Case 5: With velocity override configured
- **Setup**: No completed stories, velocity override = 15
- **Expected**: Uses configured velocity of 15
- **Result**: ✅ Uses override, not default

## Configuration

Users can override the default velocity in Forecast Configuration:

1. Click "Configure" button in Forecast tab
2. Set "Velocity Override" field
3. Save configuration
4. Forecast will use this value instead of default or calculated velocity

## Conclusion

This fix ensures the Forecast tab is immediately useful even for new projects without historical velocity data. Users can:
- ✅ See timeline projections immediately
- ✅ Understand story sequencing and dependencies
- ✅ Get completion date estimates
- ✅ Export Gantt charts for planning

The default velocity provides a reasonable baseline that improves as actual completion data accumulates.
