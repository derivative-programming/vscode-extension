# Forecast Tab Status Filter Clarification

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Issue**: Clarify which development statuses should appear in the forecast Gantt chart  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**

---

## Issue Description

The forecast tab needed clarification on which user story development statuses should be included in the Gantt chart timeline visualization.

### Required Statuses (Active Development Only)

The forecast should **only** show stories in active development:

1. **`on-hold`** - Story is paused
2. **`ready-for-dev`** - Story is ready to start
3. **`in-progress`** - Actively being developed
4. **`blocked`** - Story is blocked (reason optional)

### Excluded Statuses

Stories that have completed development should **not** appear in the forecast:

- `completed` - Development complete
- `ready-for-dev-env` - Ready for dev environment deployment
- `deployed-to-dev` - Deployed to dev environment
- `ready-for-qa` - Ready for QA testing

**Rationale**: These stories are no longer in the development phase and don't need to be forecasted.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Forecast Filter Logic

**File**: `src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/forecastFunctions.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
const forecastStories = items.filter(item => 
    item.devStatus !== "ready-for-qa" && !item.isIgnored
);
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Forecast only shows stories in active development: on-hold, ready-for-dev, in-progress, blocked
const forecastStories = items.filter(item => 
    ['on-hold', 'ready-for-dev', 'in-progress', 'blocked'].includes(item.devStatus) && 
    !item.isIgnored
);
```

**Impact**: Forecast now explicitly includes only the 4 active development statuses.

---

### 2. Updated Risk Assessment

**File**: `src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/forecastFunctions.js`

**Functions Updated**:
- `assessProjectRisk()` - Risk factor calculations
- `identifyBottlenecks()` - Bottleneck identification
- `generateRecommendations()` - Recommendation generation

**Changes**: All filter logic consistently uses the same 4-status filter:
```javascript
['on-hold', 'ready-for-dev', 'in-progress', 'blocked'].includes(item.devStatus)
```

**Before Example**:
```javascript
const unestimatedStories = items.filter(item => 
    item.devStatus !== "ready-for-qa" && (!item.storyPoints || item.storyPoints === "?")
);
```

**After Example**:
```javascript
const unestimatedStories = items.filter(item => 
    ['on-hold', 'ready-for-dev', 'in-progress', 'blocked'].includes(item.devStatus) && 
    (!item.storyPoints || item.storyPoints === "?")
);
```

---

### 3. Updated Gantt Chart Filter

**File**: `src/webviews/userStoryDev/components/scripts/ganttChart.js`

**Function**: `filterSchedules()`

**Before**:
```javascript
case "incomplete":
    return schedules.filter(s => 
        s.devStatus !== "ready-for-qa" && s.devStatus !== "completed"
    );
```

**After**:
```javascript
case "incomplete":
    // Show only stories in active development (on-hold, ready-for-dev, in-progress, blocked)
    return schedules.filter(s => 
        ['on-hold', 'ready-for-dev', 'in-progress', 'blocked'].includes(s.devStatus)
    );
```

**Impact**: The "Incomplete Only" filter now shows only active development stories.

### 4. Updated Documentation

**Files Updated**:

1. **`docs/architecture/user-story-dev-view-architecture.md`**
   - Updated Story Selection Logic section
   - Added explicit list of included statuses
   - Clarified excluded statuses
   
2. **`docs/reviews/user-story-dev-forecast-tab-review.md`**
   - Updated Story Selection Logic section
   - Updated Forecast Calculation algorithm section
   - Added status descriptions

**Before**:
```markdown
- **Included:** All stories where status ‚â† "ready-for-qa"
```

**After**:
```markdown
- **Included:** Stories in active development only:
  - `on-hold` - Story is paused
  - `ready-for-dev` - Story is ready to start
  - `in-progress` - Actively being developed
  - `blocked` - Story is blocked (reason optional)
- **Excluded:** Completed, deployed, and QA-ready stories (no longer in development)
```

## Behavior Changes

### What Changed

**Before**: The forecast included these 7 statuses:
- ‚úÖ on-hold
- ‚úÖ ready-for-dev
- ‚úÖ in-progress
- ‚úÖ blocked
- ‚ùå completed (now excluded)
- ‚ùå ready-for-dev-env (now excluded)
- ‚ùå deployed-to-dev (now excluded)

**After**: The forecast includes only these 4 statuses:
- ‚úÖ on-hold
- ‚úÖ ready-for-dev
- ‚úÖ in-progress
- ‚úÖ blocked

### Why This Is Better

1. **Semantic Clarity**: Forecasting is for **future work**. Completed/deployed stories are past work.

2. **Accurate Predictions**: Completion dates are more accurate when only counting actual development work remaining.

3. **Cleaner Visualization**: Gantt chart shows only stories that need timeline planning.

4. **Better Risk Assessment**: Risk factors focus on work that's truly incomplete.

5. **Consistent Logic**: All forecast calculations use the same filter criteria.

## Impact Analysis

### High Impact Areas ‚úÖ

1. **Gantt Chart**: Now shows fewer stories (only active development)
2. **Forecast Metrics**: Remaining hours/days calculated only for active stories
3. **Risk Assessment**: Risk score based only on active development stories
4. **Bottlenecks**: Developer workload counts only active stories
5. **Recommendations**: Suggestions focus on active development work

### Low Impact Areas üëç

1. **Velocity Calculation**: Still uses completed stories (unchanged)
2. **Details Tab**: All statuses still visible (unchanged)
3. **Board Tab**: All columns still functional (unchanged)
4. **Analysis Tab**: Charts show all statuses (unchanged)
5. **Sprint Tab**: Sprint planning unaffected (unchanged)

### User Experience üéØ

**Before**: User might see completed/deployed stories in forecast unnecessarily.

**After**: User sees only stories that need timeline planning.

**Result**: Cleaner, more focused forecast visualization.

## Testing Recommendations

### Functional Testing

- [ ] **Test 1**: Create stories with all 8 dev statuses
  - Expected: Forecast shows only 4 active development statuses
  
- [ ] **Test 2**: Mark story as "completed"
  - Expected: Story disappears from forecast Gantt chart
  
- [ ] **Test 3**: Change story from "completed" to "in-progress"
  - Expected: Story reappears in forecast
  
- [ ] **Test 4**: Filter to "Incomplete Only"
  - Expected: Shows only on-hold, ready-for-dev, in-progress, blocked
  
- [ ] **Test 5**: Check forecast metrics
  - Expected: Remaining hours only counts 4 active statuses
  
- [ ] **Test 6**: Check risk assessment
  - Expected: Risk factors only consider 4 active statuses

### Edge Cases

- [ ] **Empty Forecast**: All stories are completed/deployed/QA-ready
  - Expected: Show "No stories to forecast" message
  
- [ ] **All Blocked**: All active stories are blocked
  - Expected: High risk warning, bottleneck identified
  
- [ ] **Mixed Statuses**: Stories across all 8 statuses
  - Expected: Only 4 shown in forecast

## Code Review Checklist

- ‚úÖ All filter conditions updated consistently
- ‚úÖ Comments added explaining the filter logic
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated to match code
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded status exclusions (uses explicit inclusion)
- ‚úÖ Architecture doc reflects actual behavior
- ‚úÖ Review doc updated with clarifications

---

## Backward Compatibility

**Breaking Change**: ‚ùå No

**Reason**: This is a clarification/refinement, not a breaking API change.

**Existing Data**: ‚úÖ Fully compatible - all existing story data continues to work.

**Configuration**: ‚úÖ No config changes needed.

**Migration**: ‚úÖ No migration required.

---

## Summary

The forecast tab now explicitly shows only the **4 active development statuses** in the Gantt chart:
- `on-hold`
- `ready-for-dev`
- `in-progress`
- `blocked`

This provides:
- ‚úÖ Clearer semantic meaning (forecast = future work)
- ‚úÖ More accurate predictions (excludes completed work)
- ‚úÖ Better risk assessment (focuses on incomplete work)
- ‚úÖ Consistent filter logic across all functions
- ‚úÖ Improved documentation clarity

**Status**: Ready for testing and deployment.
