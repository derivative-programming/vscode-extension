# MCP Wizard Tools Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds two new MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools that allow GitHub Copilot and other MCP clients to open the Add Data Object and Add Report wizards in the AppDNA VS Code extension.

## Problem Statement
The requirement was to create an MCP tool to show the add report wizard, similar to how there should be one for the add data object wizard.

## Solution
Added two new MCP tools:
1. **open_add_data_object_wizard** - Opens the Add Data Object Wizard
2. **open_add_report_wizard** - Opens the Add Report Wizard

## Files Modified

### 1. src/mcp/tools/viewTools.ts
Added two new methods to the ViewTools class:
- `openAddDataObjectWizard()` - Executes command `appdna.mcp.openAddDataObjectWizard`
- `openAddReportWizard()` - Executes command `appdna.mcp.openAddReportWizard`

These methods follow the same pattern as other view tools, using the HTTP bridge to communicate with the VS Code extension.

### 2. src/commands/mcpViewCommands.ts
Added two new MCP-specific view commands:
- `appdna.mcp.openAddDataObjectWizard` - Delegates to `appdna.addObject` command
- `appdna.mcp.openAddReportWizard` - Delegates to `appdna.addReport` command

These commands are hidden from the command palette but callable via `executeCommand()`.

### 3. src/mcp/server.ts
Registered two new MCP tools in the server's `registerTools()` method:
- `open_add_data_object_wizard` - Tool for opening the Add Data Object Wizard
- `open_add_report_wizard` - Tool for opening the Add Report Wizard

Both tools include:
- Descriptive title and description
- Empty input schema (no parameters required)
- Standard output schema (success, view, message, error)
- Error handling with proper error messages

### 4. src/mcp/mcpProvider.ts
Added both tools to the VS Code API MCP provider:
- Registered `open_add_data_object_wizard` tool
- Registered `open_add_report_wizard` tool
- Updated tool count from 19 to 21
- Added both tools to disposables array for proper cleanup

### 5. MCP_README.md
Updated documentation:
- Changed total tool count from 50 to 52 tools
- Added new "Wizard Tools" section listing both wizard tools
- Added usage examples for GitHub Copilot:
  - "Open the add data object wizard"
  - "Show me the wizard to create a new data object"
  - "Open the add report wizard"
  - "Show me the wizard to create a new report"

### 6. src/test/wizard-mcp-tools.test.ts (New File)
Created unit tests to verify:
- ViewTools class has both wizard methods
- Methods are callable functions
- Methods attempt to execute commands via HTTP bridge
- Proper error handling when HTTP bridge is unavailable

## Testing
- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Unit tests created and pass
- ✅ CodeQL security scan completed with no issues
- ✅ All 52 tools registered successfully
- ✅ Compiled output verified in dist/mcp/

## Usage Examples

### With GitHub Copilot
Once the MCP server is running, users can ask GitHub Copilot:
- "Open the add data object wizard"
- "Show me the wizard to create a new data object"
- "Open the add report wizard"
- "Show me the wizard to create a new report"

### Direct Tool Invocation
The tools can be invoked directly through the MCP protocol:
```json
{
  "tool": "open_add_data_object_wizard",
  "parameters": {}
}
```

```json
{
  "tool": "open_add_report_wizard",
  "parameters": {}
}
```

## Architecture
The implementation follows the existing MCP architecture pattern:

1. **Tool Registration**: Tools are registered in both `server.ts` (stdio transport) and `mcpProvider.ts` (VS Code API)
2. **Command Delegation**: MCP commands delegate to existing VS Code extension commands
3. **HTTP Bridge**: Communication between MCP server and extension uses HTTP bridge on port 3002
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with descriptive error messages

## Impact
- Total MCP tools increased from 50 to 52
- Total VS Code API tools increased from 19 to 21
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Minimal code changes following existing patterns
- Comprehensive documentation and test coverage

## Security
- CodeQL analysis completed: **No security issues found**
- No new dependencies added
- Uses existing, secure command execution patterns
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage

## Next Steps
The implementation is complete and ready for use. Users can now:
1. Start the MCP server using the command palette or tree view
2. Ask GitHub Copilot to open the wizards using natural language
3. Use the wizards to create new data objects and reports with guided UI

## Notes
- The wizards already existed in the codebase (`addObjectWizardView.js` and `addReportWizardView.js`)
- This implementation only adds MCP tool access to existing functionality
- No changes were made to the wizard UI or behavior
- The implementation is production-ready and follows all best practices
