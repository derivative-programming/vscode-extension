# Contributing to AppDNA Model Builder

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AppDNA Model Builder VS Code extension! We welcome contributions from the community and appreciate your help in making this extension better.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (version 1.99.0 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Go to https://github.com/derivative-programming/vscode-extension
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vscode-extension.git
   cd vscode-extension
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Open in VS Code**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

5. **Start Development**
   - Press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host
   - This opens a new VS Code window with your extension loaded

## üîß Development Workflow

### Project Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension.ts          # Main extension entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/            # Command implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/           # Core services (ModelService, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webviews/          # UI components (JavaScript for webviews)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/              # Data models and interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/             # Utility functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/              # Test files
```

### Key Principles

1. **Schema-Driven Development**: All UI is generated dynamically from JSON schema
2. **TypeScript for Logic**: Use TypeScript for all extension logic (`src/` folder)
3. **JavaScript for Webviews**: Use JavaScript for webview code (`src/webviews/`)
4. **Clean Architecture**: Follow the layered architecture pattern
5. **Documentation**: Comment your code thoroughly

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the extension
npm run compile

# Watch for changes (recommended during development)
npm run watch

# Run tests
npm test

# Package the extension
npm run package
```

## üìù Coding Guidelines

### General Rules

- Use **double quotes** for strings in JavaScript
- Prefer regular string concatenation over template literals for short strings
- Add comments explaining complex logic
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Keep files focused and reasonably sized

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use explicit types where helpful
- Follow existing interface patterns
- Leverage VS Code API types properly
- Handle errors gracefully

### JavaScript Guidelines (Webviews)

- Use vanilla JavaScript (no external frameworks in webviews)
- Follow the existing event-driven pattern
- Ensure proper cleanup of event listeners
- Test in both light and dark VS Code themes

### Schema-Driven UI

- Never hardcode property names or types
- Always iterate over schema to generate UI
- Use schema descriptions for tooltips
- Handle missing properties gracefully
