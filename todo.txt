Agent todo items...

1. In the object details tabs, dont show the namespace name setting. 
It is not necessary to show the namespace name in the object details tabs.
  
2. we're currnlty showing a section 'Optional Boolean Properties'.  
a separate section is not necessary. show the properties together in alphabetical order

3. In the object details tabs, show all setting controls in alphabetical order. 
It is not necessary to note which are optional.

4. In the object details tabs, if the schema has a description for 
a property\setting, show the description when the user hovers over it.
 
5. on the object details page properties tab, show the 'add propery' 
button on the top right of the tab.  DO this on both views.  
the list view and the grid view.  The button should be in the same place on both views. 

6. On the object details page properties tab, the user is not
allowed to change the prop name on either view.

question, can i add another accordian seciton to my left sidebar view? 
7. I want to add a 'Reports' one that list all report items in one place.  In the json, reports are under objects.
