// AppDNA Settings Implementation Verification
// Created: January 2, 2025

/*
IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
======================

1. SETTINGS GEAR ICON ✓
   - Added to package.json menu contributions under "view/title"
   - Icon: "$(gear)"
   - Command: "appdna.showAppDNASettings"
   - Visibility: view == appdna && appDnaFileExists && appDnaConfigExists

2. COMMAND REGISTRATION ✓
   - Import added: import { showAppDNASettingsView } from '../webviews/appDnaSettingsView'
   - Command registered: vscode.commands.registerCommand('appdna.showAppDNASettings', ...)
   - Added to context.subscriptions

3. SETTINGS WEBVIEW ✓
   - File: src/webviews/appDnaSettingsView.js
   - Professional VS Code-themed UI
   - Simplified settings sections:
     * Code Generation (output path)
     * Editor Settings (showAdvancedProperties, expandNodesOnLoad)
   - Single Save button for streamlined UX

4. CONFIG FILE INTEGRATION ✓
   - Reads from app-dna.config.json in workspace root
   - Validates config structure before saving
   - Graceful handling of missing properties using optional chaining
   - Refreshes tree view after saving

5. CONTEXT KEY MANAGEMENT ✓
   - appDnaConfigExists context key set in fileUtils.ts
   - Settings gear icon appears only when config exists
   - Automatic updates when config file state changes

6. USER EXPERIENCE ✓
   - Settings save triggers tree view refresh
   - Professional error handling and validation
   - Form values properly loaded and saved
   - Consistent with VS Code design patterns

TESTING CHECKLIST:
==================
[ ] Settings gear icon appears when model and config are loaded
[ ] Settings view opens when gear icon is clicked
[ ] Form loads with current config values
[ ] Changes can be saved and persist to config file
[ ] Tree view refreshes after saving settings
[ ] Advanced properties visibility toggles work
[ ] Expand on load setting works
[ ] Output path setting updates correctly

INTEGRATION POINTS:
===================
- Tree view uses getShowAdvancedPropertiesFromConfig() to filter items
- Tree view uses getExpandNodesOnLoadFromConfig() for auto-expansion
- Code generation uses getOutputPathFromConfig() for save location
- Context keys control UI element visibility

ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE:
========================
✓ Follows layered architecture (UI -> Service -> Data)
✓ Uses TypeScript for commands, JavaScript for webviews
✓ Professional VS Code design patterns
✓ Proper error handling and validation
✓ Dynamic UI generation from config structure
✓ Small, focused files
✓ Comprehensive commenting
