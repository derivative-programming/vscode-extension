### Role-Based Views
Create views showing the app from specific roles (e.g., Manager, User), displaying accessible pages, forms, or workflows to understand role-specific experiences and access controls.

### Action-Based Analysis
Analyze distribution of actions (view all, view, add, update, delete) across objects in user stories, identifying heavily used objects or missing actions to guide prioritization.


### Role-Based Access Validation
Verify roles have appropriate access to pages and actions per user stories, ensuring security and compliance, displayed in a dedicated view or annotations.

## 2. Workflow Visualization and Analysis

### Interactive Workflow Flowchart View
Create a Mermaid-based or interactive view for multi-step workflows, with nodes for steps linked to pages and edges for transitions/conditions, filterable by pages or data objects.

### Workflow Simulation and Debugging
Simulate workflows by stepping through pages and showing data object changes (e.g., a form updating a User object's status), highlighting issues like missing pages or invalid transitions.

### Workflow Comparison Tool
Compare workflows to identify similarities or redundancies, visualized in Mermaid flowcharts or a table, to optimize processes.
