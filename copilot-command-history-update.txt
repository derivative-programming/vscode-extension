Command: Enhance change request validation logic for auto-applied items
- Updated validatePendingChangeRequests function to handle the case where the current value already matches the new value
- When a change request's old value doesn't match current value, but new value does match current value:
  * Now marked as "Applied" instead of "Rejected"
  * Auto-approved and marked as processed to indicate the change is already in effect
  * Added detailed logging to explain the different validation states
- This improves user experience by properly identifying changes that have already been applied through other means
- The previous behavior incorrectly marked these as "out of date" and rejected them
