Command: "Add similar plus icon button on the GENERAL flow treeview item and have it open a similar 'September 15, 2025 - Analytics Metrics View Improvements

Commands Completed:
1. Refactor metric calculations into separate functions ✓
2. Add comprehensive error handling ✓  
3. Enhance chart tooltips ✓
4. Fix checkbox persistence issue ✓

Architecture Notes:
- Extracted 12 individual metric calculation functions from the monolithic getCurrentMetricsData() function
- Each metric calculation function now has try-catch error handling with graceful degradation
- Functions return default values (0) when errors occur and log errors to console
- Combined duplicate logic for role requirements (assigned/unassigned) into single function
- Enhanced Chart.js tooltips with custom formatting and VS Code theme colors
- Fixed checkbox state persistence bug in date range filtering by preserving selectedMetrics Set
- Improved user experience by cleaning up unavailable metrics when changing date ranges

Files Modified:
- src/commands/metricsAnalysisCommands.ts: Refactored metric calculations with error handling
- src/webviews/metricsAnalysisView.js: Enhanced tooltips and fixed checkbox persistence

Technical Improvements:
- Better error isolation - single metric failure won't break entire view
- More maintainable code with smaller, focused functions  
- Improved user experience with enhanced tooltips showing exact values and dates
- Fixed UX issue where date range changes would lose metric selections

PREVIOUS ENTRIES:
USER REQUEST: "all cells in the export need to be wrapped in double quotes"
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made**:
1. Modified `saveRequirementsFulfillmentToCSV()` function in `requirementsFulfillmentCommands.ts`
   - Updated header row generation to wrap all headers in double quotes: `headers.map(header => "\"${header}\"")`
   - Changed cell processing logic to wrap ALL values in double quotes instead of only when needed
   - Replaced conditional quoting with universal quoting: `"${escapedValue}"`
   - Maintains proper quote escaping by doubling internal quotes: `replace(/"/g, '""')`

**Technical Details**:
- Previously: Only wrapped cells containing commas, quotes, or newlines
- Now: ALL cells are wrapped in double quotes for consistent CSV formatting
- Headers: "Role","Data Object","Action","Access","User Story Status","Mapping Status","User Journey Status","Fulfillment Status"
- Data cells: All values properly escaped and quoted regardless of content

**Architecture Notes**:
- Follows standard CSV RFC 4180 formatting for quoted fields
- Ensures consistent parsing across different CSV readers/applications
- Maintains backward compatibility while improving data integrity

2024-12-31 XX:XX:XX - USER STORY REQUIREMENT FULFILLMENTS VIEW - AUTO-OPEN CSV ON DOWNLOAD
USER REQUEST: "user story requirement fulfillments view downlaod to csv button shoudl open the csv immediately"
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made**:
1. Modified `requirementsFulfillmentCommands.ts` in 'saveCsvToWorkspace' case
   - Added automatic file opening after CSV save operation
   - Added `vscode.window.showTextDocument(fileUri)` to open CSV immediately
   - Pattern matches other views like workflowListCommands.ts

**Technical Details**:
- CSV download flow: webview → 'exportToCSV' → extension generates CSV → 'csvExportReady' → webview sends 'saveCsvToWorkspace' → extension saves and now opens file
- Uses same pattern as other list views for consistency
- File opens in VS Code editor immediately after successful save

**Architecture Notes**:
- Maintains consistent UX across all CSV export functionality
- No changes to webview logic required - only extension command handler
- File path constructed using workspace root and filename from message data
