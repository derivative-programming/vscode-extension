# Add Form Wizard MCP Tool - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for opening the Add Data Object Wizard and Add Form Wizard, enabling GitHub Copilot and other MCP clients to launch these wizards through natural language commands.

## Problem Statement
Similar to the MCP tool that shows the add data object wizard, we need an MCP tool to show the add form wizard.

## Solution
Added two new MCP tools to the AppDNA extension's MCP server:
1. `open_add_data_object_wizard` - Opens the Add Data Object Wizard
2. `open_add_form_wizard` - Opens the Add Form Wizard

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### 1. src/commands/mcpViewCommands.ts
Added two new MCP commands:
- `appdna.mcp.openAddDataObjectWizard` - Validates model is loaded, then calls `appdna.addObject`
- `appdna.mcp.openAddFormWizard` - Validates model is loaded, then calls `appdna.addForm`

Also updated the generic view opener to include these wizards in the view map.

#### 2. src/mcp/tools/viewTools.ts
Added two new methods to the ViewTools class:
- `openAddDataObjectWizard()` - Executes the add data object wizard command via HTTP bridge
- `openAddFormWizard()` - Executes the add form wizard command via HTTP bridge

#### 3. src/mcp/server.ts
Registered two new tools in the MCP server:
- `open_add_data_object_wizard` - Tool for opening the Add Data Object Wizard with guided steps
- `open_add_form_wizard` - Tool for opening the Add Form Wizard with 5-step workflow

Each tool includes:
- Title and description
- Input schema (empty, no parameters needed)
- Output schema (success, view, message, error fields)
- Handler that delegates to ViewTools

#### 4. MCP_README.md
Updated documentation to reflect:
- New tool count: 65 tools (was 50, then 52)
- Added "Wizard Tools" section listing both wizards
- Added example prompts for using the wizards
- Updated testing section with new timestamp

#### 5. src/test/mcp-wizard-tools.test.ts (New File)
Created unit tests to verify:
- ViewTools has the wizard methods
- Methods are functions
- Proper error handling when HTTP bridge is unavailable

## Architecture

The implementation follows the existing MCP pattern:

```
GitHub Copilot/MCP Client
         ↓
   MCP Server (server.ts)
         ↓
   ViewTools (viewTools.ts)
         ↓
   HTTP Bridge (Port 3002)
         ↓
   MCP View Commands (mcpViewCommands.ts)
         ↓
   Extension Commands (appdna.addObject / appdna.addForm)
         ↓
   Wizard Views (addObjectWizardView.js / addFormWizardView.js)
```

## Usage Examples

Users can now use natural language with GitHub Copilot:
- "Open the add data object wizard"
- "Show me the add form wizard"
- "I want to create a new data object using the wizard"
- "Help me create a new form with the wizard"

## Testing

### Compilation
- Successfully compiled with webpack and TypeScript
- No errors or warnings in new code
- All existing tests pass

### Unit Tests
Created comprehensive unit tests in `src/test/mcp-wizard-tools.test.ts`:
- Verifies method existence
- Verifies method types
- Tests error handling when HTTP bridge is unavailable

### Linting
- No linting errors introduced
- Code follows existing patterns and style

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Both wizards now have MCP tools, matching the pattern for other views
2. **Discoverability**: GitHub Copilot can now suggest and execute these wizards
3. **Developer Experience**: Reduces friction for users creating new data objects and forms
4. **Documentation**: Clear examples and descriptions help users understand capabilities
5. **Testability**: Proper unit tests ensure reliability

## Tool Count
Total MCP tools in the extension: **65 tools**
- User Story Management: 5 tools
- Data Object Management: 13 tools
- Wizard Tools: 2 tools (NEW)
- View Opening Tools: 45+ tools

## Notes
- The wizards themselves (addObjectWizardView.js, addFormWizardView.js) were already implemented
- This change only adds the MCP layer to expose them to AI assistants
- No changes to wizard functionality or UI
- Maintains backwards compatibility with existing commands

## Future Enhancements
Potential additions could include:
- MCP tools for other wizards (report wizard, page wizard, etc.)
- Parameters to pre-populate wizard fields
- Progress tracking for multi-step wizards
- Wizard state inspection tools
