## üîß Screenshots Troubleshooting

### Why Screenshots Weren't Showing
- ‚ùå **Wrong Method**: The `screenshots` array in package.json is NOT used by VS Code Marketplace
- ‚úÖ **Correct Method**: Screenshots must be embedded in README.md using markdown image syntax
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: All 5 screenshots now properly added to README.md

### How VS Code Marketplace Displays Images
1. **README.md Images**: The marketplace renders your README.md and displays any images embedded in it
2. **GitHub Raw URLs**: Images must use `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs, NOT `github.com/blob/` URLs
3. **Automatic Display**: No special configuration needed - just proper markdown syntax

### Screenshot Display Requirements
- ‚úÖ Images must be in your GitHub repository (in `media/` folder)
- ‚úÖ Must use **raw GitHub URLs**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owner/repo/branch/path`
- ‚ùå **Don't use blob URLs**: `https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/branch/path` (causes broken images)
- ‚úÖ Must use proper markdown image syntax: `![Alt Text](URL)`
- ‚úÖ Images should be high resolution (screenshots are 1920x1080+)

### After Publishing
Your 5 screenshots will appear in the marketplace description:
1. **Main Extension Overview** - Shows tree view and overall interface
2. **Page Preview Feature** - Demonstrates role-based filtering
3. **Page Flow Flowchart** - Shows flowchart-style diagrams
4. **Page Flow Graph** - Shows graph-style page relationships
5. **User Stories Management** - Displays user story interface
