To create the marketplace icon (icon.png), you need to:

1. Create a 128x128 pixel PNG image
2. Use the design from media/icon.svg as reference
3. The icon should feature:
   - Blue background (#007ACC - VS Code blue)
   - White DNA double helix in the center
   - "AppDNA" text at the bottom in white
   - Modern, professional appearance

You can use any image editor like:
- GIMP (free)
- Photoshop
- Canva
- Online SVG to PNG converters

Save the final image as "media/icon.png" (128x128 pixels)

Alternatively, you can use this online converter:
