A professional VS Code extension for building application models and automatically generating source code for multiple platforms and languages.

Transform your development workflow: design your application model once, then generate complete source code for .NET, Python, Web applications, Mobile Apps, AR/VR applications (planned), and more. Pull the generated code into your repositories and accelerate your development process.

## Features

### üèóÔ∏è Schema-Driven Model Builder

## Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. **Install the Extension**: Search for "AppDNA Model Builder" in the VS Code marketplace
2. **Open Your Project**: Open a folder where you want to create your AppDNA model
3. **Follow the Welcome Workflow**: The extension provides a guided 9-step workflow:

### AppDNA Development Workflow
The extension provides a comprehensive workflow for model-driven development:

1. **Create New Project Model** - Start with a new AppDNA JSON model file
2. **Update Project Settings** - Configure project metadata and context information  
3. **Register/Login to Model Services** - Access AI-powered cloud services
4. **Add Model Features** - Browse and select features from the feature catalog
5. **Request Model AI Processing** - Enhance your model with AI assistance
6. **Request Model Validation** - Validate and improve your model structure
7. **Select Fabrication Blueprints** - Choose templates for code generation
8. **Request Model Fabrication** - Generate source code for multiple platforms
9. **Manual Model Editing** - Fine-tune your model and iterate

### Quick Actions
## Keyboard Shortcuts

All shortcuts use the simple `Alt+A [key]` format to avoid conflicts with standard VS Code shortcuts:

### File Operations
- `Alt+A N` - Create new AppDNA model file
- `Alt+A S` - Save model to file

### Add Items
- `Alt+A O` - Add new data object
- `Alt+A R` - Add new report
- `Alt+A F` - Add new form

### View Controls
- `Alt+A E` - Expand all top level items
- `Alt+A C` - Collapse all top level items
- `Alt+A T` - Refresh view (re**T**resh)
- `Alt+A I` - Show filter (f**I**lter)
- `Alt+A X` - Clear filter (clear = **X**)

### Diagrams & Views
- `Alt+A H` - Show hierarchy diagram
- `Alt+A P` - Show page flow diagram

### Settings & Help
- `Alt+A G` - Show AppDNA settings (confi**G**)
- `Alt+A W` - Show welcome screen
- `Alt+A Q` - Show help (**Q**uestion)
- **Welcome View** - Access the guided workflow anytime
- **Tree View** - Navigate and manage your model structure

## Extension Interface

A Windows app version of this extension is available [here](https://github.com/derivative-programming/ModelWinApp).

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

The extension includes built-in MCP server capabilities for seamless integration with AI assistants and external tools:

### MCP Server Features
- **Local MCP Server**: Starts/stops a local MCP server for direct integration
- **HTTP Server Bridge**: Provides HTTP access to MCP functionality for web-based tools
- **Real-time Status**: Visual indicators show server running/stopped states in the tree view
- **Tool Integration**: Exposes AppDNA model operations as MCP tools for AI assistants

### Server Management
- Start/stop servers directly from the PROJECT section in the tree view
- Automatic port management and conflict resolution
- Status monitoring with visual feedback
- Configurable server settings through AppDNA configuration

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.99.0 or higher

## Extension Settings

This extension provides comprehensive configuration through both VS Code settings and AppDNA-specific configuration:

### VS Code Settings
- `appDNA.modelServiceUrl`: Configure the URL for external Model Services API (default: https://modelservicesapi.derivative-programming.com)

### AppDNA Configuration (app-dna.config.json)
The extension creates and manages an `app-dna.config.json` file in your workspace with these configurable options:

- **Output Path**: Directory where generated code files will be saved (relative to workspace root)
- **Show Advanced Properties**: Controls visibility of advanced tree view items (Lexicon, User Stories, MCP Servers, Pages)
- **Expand Nodes on Load**: Automatically expands all tree view sections when a model is loaded
- **Model File Name**: Specify custom name for your AppDNA model file (default: app-dna.json)

### Configuration Access
- **Settings Gear Icon**: Click the gear icon in the AppDNA tree view title bar
- **AppDNA Settings View**: User-friendly interface for editing configuration properties
