A professional VS Code extension for building application models and automatically generating source code for multiple platforms and languages.

Transform your development workflow: design your application model once, then generate complete source code for .NET, Python, Web applications, Mobile Apps, AR/VR applications (planned), and more. Pull the generated code into your repositories and accelerate your development process.

## Page Preview Feature

The Page Preview feature provides an interactive way to preview your forms and reports before full implementation, helping you visualize the user experience during the design phase.

### Key Features
- **Role-Based Filtering**: Filter pages by user roles to see what different user types can access
- **Interactive Form Preview**: See how forms will appear with parameter fields, buttons, and layout
- **Real-Time Updates**: Preview updates automatically when you modify your model
- **Navigation Integration**: Switch seamlessly between preview and detailed form/report editing
- **Professional Styling**: Preview uses VS Code theme for consistent, professional appearance

### How to Use
1. **Access the Preview**: Click the eye icon next to "PAGES" in the tree view, or use `Alt+A V`
2. **Filter by Role**: Use checkboxes to filter pages by required user roles
3. **Select a Page**: Choose from the dropdown of available forms and reports
4. **Preview Content**: View the page layout, fields, and available actions
5. **Open Details**: Click "View Full Page Details" to open the complete form/report editor

### Requirements
- Enable "Show Advanced Properties" in AppDNA settings to see the PAGES section
- Forms and reports must have `isPage="true"` property to appear in preview
- Role requirements are determined by `roleRequired` property on forms/reports

The Page Preview feature is particularly useful for:
- **UI/UX Design**: Visualizing user interfaces before implementation
- **Role Planning**: Understanding access patterns and user workflows
- **Client Demos**: Showing stakeholders how the application will look and function
- **Development Planning**: Identifying form requirements and user interactions

- **HTTP Server Bridge**: Provides HTTP access to MCP functionality for web-based tools
- **Real-time Status**: Visual indicators show server running/stopped states in the tree view
- **Tool Integration**: Exposes AppDNA model operations as MCP tools for AI assistants

### Server Management
- Start/stop servers directly from the PROJECT section in the tree view
- Automatic port management and conflict resolution
- Status monitoring with visual feedback
- Configurable server settings through AppDNA configuration

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.99.0 or higher

- **Show Advanced Properties**: Controls visibility of advanced tree view items (Lexicon, User Stories, MCP Servers, Pages)
- **Expand Nodes on Load**: Automatically expands all tree view sections when a model is loaded
- **Model File Name**: Specify custom name for your AppDNA model file (default: app-dna.json)

### Configuration Access
