[![Visual Studio Marketplace Downloads](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/d/derivative-programming.appdna)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=derivative-programming.appdna)

A professional VS Code extension for building application models and automatically generating source code for multiple platforms and languages.

Transform your development workflow: design your application model once, then generate complete source code for .NET, Python, Web applications, Mobile Apps, AR/VR applications (planned), and more. Pull the generated code into your repositories and accelerate your development process.

## Why AppDNA?

**Software development should focus on business logic, complex services, and design-intensive UI.** Less time should be spent on straightforward structured boilerplate software code. AppDNA enables this principle by:

- **Automating Boilerplate**: Generate complete data access layers, CRUD operations, and standard UI components automatically
- **Focusing on Business Value**: Spend your development time on complex business rules, innovative features, and exceptional user experiences
- **Reducing Repetitive Coding**: Eliminate hours of writing similar database queries, form validations, and standard API endpoints
- **Accelerating Delivery**: Get from concept to working application faster by focusing on what makes your application unique

### AppDNA Chat Mode

The AppDNA extension automatically creates a specialized GitHub Copilot Chat mode called "AppDNA" in your workspace. When you install and activate the extension, it will create:

```
.github/
  chatmodes/
    appdna.chatmode.md  ‚Üê Contains the AppDNA chat mode configuration
```

To use the AppDNA chat mode:

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Alt+I or Cmd+Alt+I)
2. Click the chat mode selector (looks like a sparkles icon) in the chat input
3. Select "AppDNA" from the available modes

The AppDNA chat mode is pre-configured with knowledge of:
- AppDNA schema structure and validation rules
- Extension architecture and coding guidelines
- Model-driven development patterns
- Multi-platform code generation capabilities
- Best practices for building application models

**Important:** The AppDNA chat mode prioritizes using MCP tools for all model modifications and code generation. Instead of directly editing files, it will guide Copilot to use the extension's MCP tools for safe, validated changes through the AppDNA API.

Use this mode for questions about AppDNA model design, schema compliance, extension features, and development workflows.

### MCP Architecture
- **Port 3000**: MCP Server (main protocol endpoint)
- **Port 3001**: Data Bridge (read extension data)
- **Port 3002**: Command Bridge (execute VS Code commands)
- **MCP SDK Version**: 1.20.0
- **JSON-RPC 2.0**: Standard protocol over stdio or HTTP transports

For complete MCP documentation including all 105 tools, examples, and configuration details, see [MCP_README.md](./MCP_README.md).

## Requirements

## Extension Settings

This extension provides comprehensive configuration through both VS Code settings and AppDNA-specific configuration:

### VS Code Settings
- `appDNA.modelServiceUrl`: Configure the URL for external Model Services API (default: https://modelservicesapi.derivative-programming.com)

### AppDNA Configuration (app-dna.config.json)
The extension creates and manages an `app-dna.config.json` file in your workspace with these configurable options:

- **Output Path**: Directory where generated code files will be saved (relative to workspace root)
- **Show Advanced Properties**: Controls visibility of advanced tree view items (Lexicon, User Stories, MCP Servers, Pages)

## Known Issues

### User Story QA View
- **Summary Statistics Display** (Analysis Tab): Statistics may not update correctly due to an ID mismatch bug. This is scheduled for immediate fix.
  - **Workaround**: Refresh the view by switching tabs
  - **Status**: Known bug, fix planned (5 minute fix)
  - **Impact**: Visual only - data and functionality are not affected

### Performance Notes
- **Large Datasets**: Views with 100+ user stories may experience slight delays during filtering and sorting operations
  - **Recommendation**: Use filters to narrow down the dataset for better performance
  - **Status**: Performance optimizations planned for future release

### Code Quality Notes
- The User Story QA View is feature-complete and fully functional
- A comprehensive code review (October 2025) identified opportunities for code modularization and performance improvements
- These improvements are planned for a future maintenance release and do not affect current functionality
- See `docs/reviews/user-story-qa-view-code-review.md` for detailed analysis
