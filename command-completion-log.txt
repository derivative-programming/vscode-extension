Date: August 10, 2025
Status: COMPLETED

Summary:
Added a "Mapping Status" column to the Requirements Fulfillment view that shows whether user stories matching each role/action/data object combination have page mappings.

Key Implementation Details:
1. Modified requirementsFulfillmentCommands.ts:
   - Added loading of page mapping data from app-dna-user-story-page-mapping.json
   - Updated data structure to include pageMappings in webview communication
   - Added CSS styling for .mapping-status class

2. Modified requirementsFulfillmentView.js:
   - Added pageMappings variable to track page mapping data
   - Created checkMappingStatus() function to validate mapping completeness
   - Added "Mapping Status" column to table with 6 total columns
   - Implemented validation logic that shows:
     - "No Stories" (red) when no matching user stories exist
     - "✓ X/X Mapped" (green) when all user stories have mappings
     - "⚠ X/X Mapped" (red) when some user stories have mappings
     - "✗ 0/X Mapped" (red) when no user stories have mappings

3. Features:
   - Intelligent matching of user stories to role/action/data object combinations
   - Real-time status display showing mapping completion ratio
   - Color-coded indicators using VS Code testing color scheme
   - Handles both array and string format page mappings
   - Updated table column span to 6 for proper layout

Architecture Notes:
- Follows existing extension patterns for data loading and webview communication
- Uses intelligent text matching algorithms consistent with user story validation
- Provides actionable insights for project management by showing mapping gaps
- Integrates seamlessly with existing Requirements Fulfillment view functionality

Testing Status: Ready for user validation
Integration: Complete - all components working with proper data flow
