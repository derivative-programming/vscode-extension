Agent todo items...

- In the object details tabs, if the schema has a description for 
a property\setting, show the description when the user hovers over it. 
    - table view
on the object details page on the properties tab in the list view when you hover over the label it shows the description of the property. I need to do the same on the table view on the table column header text
 
 
- implement 'add property' 
i need to handle the 'add property' button. I need to ask for the property name but i also need to give an option to allow the user to 'bulk add' multiple properties and give them a multi line textbox to add a property for each line entered. validation rules... 1. no spaces allowed in names. 2. alpha characters only.
