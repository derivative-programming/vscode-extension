Agent todo items...
 
- when adding a model file, also add the config file 

- implement 'add property' 
i need to handle the 'add property' button. I need to ask for the property name but i also need to give an option to allow the user to 'bulk add' multiple properties and give them a multi line textbox to add a property for each line entered. validation rules... 1. no spaces allowed in names. 2. alpha characters only.
