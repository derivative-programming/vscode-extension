- implement 'add property' 
i need to handle the 'add property' button. I need to ask for the property name but i also need to give an option to allow the user to 'bulk add' multiple properties and give them a multi line textbox to add a property for each line entered. validation rules... 1. no spaces allowed in names. 2. alpha characters only.

-refresh button should reload all open data object windows

- save button should save model to the same file

- add a config file that sets the model file location, instead of hardcoding app-dna.json
... a user that has a project that installs the extension should allow for a config file in their project to help set the configuration of the extension. It should have a setting to tell the extension the name of the model file

- automatically create a config file if it does not exist
