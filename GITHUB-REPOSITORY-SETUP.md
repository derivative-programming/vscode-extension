# Making Your GitHub Repository Public with Protected Main Branch

## 🔓 Step 1: Make Repository Public

1. **Navigate to Your Repository**
   - Go to https://github.com/derivative-programming/appdna-vscode-extension
   - Or whatever your current repository URL is

2. **Change Visibility Settings**
   - Click on **Settings** tab (far right in the repository menu)
   - Scroll down to the **"Danger Zone"** section at the bottom
   - Click **"Change repository visibility"**
   - Select **"Make public"**
   - Type your repository name to confirm
   - Click **"I understand, change repository visibility"**

## 🛡️ Step 2: Protect the Main Branch (Only You Can Merge)

1. **Go to Branch Protection Settings**
   - In your repository, click **Settings** → **Branches** (left sidebar)
   - Click **"Add rule"** or **"Add branch protection rule"**

2. **Configure Protection Rule**
   ```
   Branch name pattern: main
   
   ✅ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB
   ✅ Require a pull request before merging
       ✅ Require approvals: 1
       ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
       ✅ Require review from code owners
   ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
   ✅ Allow force pushes: Everyone (but you control reviews)
   ✅ Allow deletions: NO
   ```

3. **Click "Create" to save the protection rule**

## 📁 Step 3: Create CODEOWNERS File (via GitHub Website)

## 📁 Step 3: Create CODEOWNERS File (via GitHub Website)

1. **Navigate to Your Repository Root**
   - Go to your repository main page
   - Click **"Create new file"** button

2. **Create the CODEOWNERS File**
   - In the file name field, type: `.github/CODEOWNERS`
   - GitHub will automatically create the `.github` folder
   
3. **Add CODEOWNERS Content**
   ```
   # Global code ownership - only vroche can approve changes
   * @vroche

   # Specific protections for critical files
   package.json @vroche
   README.md @vroche
   src/ @vroche
   ```
   
4. **Commit the File**
   - Add commit message: "Add CODEOWNERS file for branch protection"
   - Click **"Commit new file"**

**Note:** This ensures only vroche can approve and merge changes to main!

## 🔧 Step 4: Additional Security Settings

### **Repository Settings to Consider:**
- **"Allow merge commits"**: ✅ Enabled
- **"Allow squash merging"**: ✅ Enabled  
- **"Allow rebase merging"**: ✅ Enabled
- **"Always suggest updating pull request branches"**: ✅ Enabled
- **"Allow auto-merge"**: ❌ Disabled (for more control)
- **"Automatically delete head branches"**: ✅ Enabled (cleanup)

## 🤝 Step 5: Contributor Workflow

With these settings, contributors will need to:

1. **Fork your repository**
2. **Create feature branch** in their fork
3. **Submit Pull Request** to your main branch
4. **Wait for vroche's approval** before merging
5. **vroche reviews and merges** when ready

## ⚡ Summary: All Steps via GitHub Website

### **Complete Website-Only Workflow:**

1. **Make Repository Public**
   - Settings → Danger Zone → Change repository visibility → Make public

2. **Protect Main Branch**
   - Settings → Branches → Add rule → Configure protection settings

3. **Create CODEOWNERS File**
   - Repository root → Create new file → `.github/CODEOWNERS` → Add content → Commit

4. **Configure Additional Settings**
   - Settings → General → Scroll to merge options and configure as needed

All done through the GitHub website interface! 🎉

## 🎯 Result

After these steps:
- ✅ **Repository is public** - anyone can view and fork
- ✅ **Main branch is protected** - no direct pushes allowed
- ✅ **Only vroche can merge** - must approve every PR
- ✅ **Contributors can fork and submit PRs**
- ✅ **Marketplace publishing links work** (public repo)

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **vroche can still push directly** if admin (but better to use PRs)
- **Emergency access**: Repository admins can bypass protections if needed
- **Update README links**: Your marketplace README links will now work since repo is public
- **Consider adding CI/CD**: You can add GitHub Actions for automated testing

---

**Your repository will be public but fully under vroche's control! 🎉**
